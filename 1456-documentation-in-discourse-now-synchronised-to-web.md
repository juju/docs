As a follow up to my post entitled [Documentation migrated to Discourse](/t/documentation-migrated-to-discourse) another phase is now complete. Updates to initial topic posts in the [Docs](/c/docs/none) category are now published, pretty much instantaneously, on the documentation web site: [docs.jujucharms.com](https://docs.jujucharms.com). :man_cartwheeling: The home page and the [commands](https://docs.jujucharms.com/commands) page are treated separately.

At the top of docs.jujucharms.com there are links to both the documentation web site (redundant?) and Discourse:

At the bottom of each documentation web page there is a blurb pointing readers to the corresponding Discourse topic if they wish to improve upon it:
