Hi all, I've taken up the baton of improving prospective users' first impressions of the project and Juju's onboarding experience overall.

After a few iterations, I am interested in gathering feedback. What resonates? What would you be most happy to point people to? 

Version 1:

> Juju is the simplest way to manage software that spans machines.
>
> Juju allows you to retain a high-level understanding of all the parts of your system without being bogged down needing to know every hostname, every machine, every subnet and every specification of every storage volume.
>
> Focus on your applications and their relations. Create a development environment on your laptop, then recreate that environment on the public cloud, onto bare metal servers or into a Kubernetes cluster.
> 
> Maximise your productivity by encapsulating specialist knowledge into Juju charms. They create repeatable, systematic and secure devops practices for all stages of your product’s lifecycle. Juju simplifies deployment, maintenance, scaling up and winding down.

Another attempt:

> **Why Juju?**
>  
> -    Reduce complexity
> -    Enable repeatability
> -    Codify operations knowledge
> -    Simplify day two
> -    Maintain portability
>
> If your infrastructure can’t be understood by everyone in your organisation, there’s an issue. Juju focuses on the applications that your deployment defines and how they are related.
>
> Requiring everyone to know every hostname, every machine, every subnet and every storage volume is brittle. This means change is complicated, on-boarding is difficult and tends to create knowledge silos. Juju makes those details available, but places the deployment model at the front.
> 
> With Juju, your team maintains a practical high-level view that makes your backend more adaptable to changes over time. Extending your product should be as simple as deploying its first prototype.
>
> **What is Juju?**
>
> Juju is a devops tool that reduces operational complexity through application modelling. Once a model is described, Juju identifies the necessary steps to make that model a reality.
>
> Juju has three core concepts: models, applications and relations. Consider a whiteboard drawing of your service. The whiteboard's border is the model, its circles are applications and the lines between the circles are relations.
>
> Juju uses an active agent deployed alongside your applications. That agent orchestrates infrastructure, and manages applications through the product life cycle.
