Just wanted to bring this to light as I am scanning through ... I can't seem to locate any documentation on what constraints and bootstrap-constraints are available, even more so what `config` is available to me when bootstrapping. Can we highlight a page in the docs where controller configuration/getting started references a clear list or table of the configurations that are available to a user when getting started and creating a juju controller?

As an example, I am trying to look into how to bootstrap using ssl, and can't seem to locate anything that tells me what my options are (other then @rick_h golden goose blog posts on bootstrapping and controller lifecycle) -  I'm just not sure where to go or what to do.

Do others feel this?
