Creating a controller is known as the "bootstrap process". Controllers are created with the `bootstrap` command.

The most common uses of the `bootstrap` command use the following syntax:

```plain
juju bootstrap [--credential <credential>] <cloud>[/<region>] <controller-name>
```

The `bootstrap` command takes many optional parameters. They are explained in the examples below. 

[note]
You may not need to create your own controller to get started. If you are intending to use a public cloud, you can access [JAAS](https://jaas.ai/getting-started), a hosted Juju controller service:

```plain
juju login jaas
```

You may also need to create an account with the [Ubuntu SSO service](https://login.ubuntu.com/).

## Pre-requisites

To create a controller, you require:

 -  a [cloud](/t/clouds/1100) to be defined, and
 -  [credentials](/t/1112) for that cloud to be loaded

If you are starting with Juju, they may not be available yet. Start by [adding a cloud](/t/clouds/1100), then [add credentials](/t/1112), and return to this page.


## Basic Process

<h3 id="heading--common-invocation">Common invocation</h3>

A very common way to create a controller is by just specifying a cloud name and a controller name:

``` text
juju bootstrap aws aws-controller
```

Note that if a controller name is not specified one will be assigned based on the cloud name and the cloud's default region.

<h3 id="heading--create-a-controller-interactively">Create a controller interactively</h3>

You can create a controller interactively by omitting a cloud name altogether:

``` text
juju bootstrap
```

You will be prompted for what cloud and region to use as well as the controller name. Do not use this method if you intend on specifying anything else.

## Advanced

### Configuring your cloud environment

During the bootstrap process, you are able to define many configuration options to tailor your deployment. The examples on this page describe how to apply them.

To learn more about configuration options available, see these resources:

- [Configuring controllers](/t/configuring-controllers/1107)
- [Configuring models](/t/configuring-models/1151)
- [Using constraints](/t/using-constraints/1060)

### Advanced Examples

<h3 id="heading--set-default-model-constraints">Set default model constraints</h3>

Default constraints can be set for every model within a controller. This, in turn, affects the machines that will be created within those models.

Here, every machine, including the controller itself, will have at least 4GiB of memory:

```text
juju bootstrap --constraints mem=4G localhost
```

See page [Using constraints](/t/using-constraints/1060) for details on constraints.

<h3 id="heading--set-constraints-for-a-controller">Set constraints for a controller</h3>

To request at least 4GiB of memory and two CPUs for an AWS controller:

``` text
juju bootstrap --bootstrap-constraints "mem=4G cores=2" aws
```

If any of the constraints are also used with `--constraints` then the ones given via `--bootstrap-constraints` will be used.

<h3 id="heading--create-a-controller-of-a-specific-series">Create a controller of a specific series</h3>

The controller will be deployed upon Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) by default.

Here, we name the resulting LXD controller 'lxd-bionic' to reflect that:

``` text
juju bootstrap localhost lxd-bionic
```

To select a different series the `--bootstrap-series` option is used.

Below, a google (GCE) controller based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) is requested explicitly (and is given the name 'gce-xenial'):

``` text
juju bootstrap --bootstrap-series=xenial google gce-xenial
```

<h3 id="heading--set-model-configuration-keys">Set model configuration keys</h3>

Model configuration keys can be set using either of the following two options:

1. `--config`
1. `--model-default`

The `--config` option affects the initial models, 'controller' and 'default'.

The `--model-default` option affects the initial models as well as any subsequently added models (`add-model` command) . The `model-defaults` command can be used once the controller is created in order to achieve the same result.

To create a controller (named "vsp") for cloud "vsphere" while specifying the vSphere datastore "xtian-ds1" for every model, including any future ones:

```text
juju bootstrap --model-default datastore=xtian-ds1 vsphere vsp
```

<h3 id="heading--set-model-configuration-keys-both-with-a-file-and-individually">Set model configuration keys both with a file and individually</h3>

This example demonstrates how to use both a previously defined configuration file (`~/config-rackspace.yaml`) and individual configuration values. The latter values take precedence over those that may be included in the file:

``` text
juju bootstrap \
    --config=~/config-rackspace.yaml \
    --config image-stream=daily \
    rackspace controller-rackspace
```

<h3 id="heading--create-a-controller-using-a-non-default-region">Create a controller using a non-default region</h3>

The `clouds` command lists available clouds and denotes a default region for each. To specify a different region during controller creation:

``` text
juju bootstrap aws/us-west-2 mycontroller
```

This is where omitting a custom controller name could be appropriate, as doing so will result in a name based on the non-default region. Here the controller would be named 'aws-us-west-2':

``` text
juju bootstrap aws/us-west-2
```

<h3 id="heading--create-a-controller-using-a-different-mongodb-profile">Create a controller using a different MongoDB profile</h3>

MongoDB has two memory profile settings available, 'default' and 'low'. The first setting is the profile shipped by default with MongoDB. The second is a more conservative memory profile that uses less memory. To select which one your controller uses when it is created, use:

``` text
juju bootstrap --config mongo-memory-profile=low
```

<h3 id="heading--use-a-custom-charm-store">Use a custom charm store</h3>

Sometimes the charms you're interested in do not yet reside in the default production charm store (`https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore`). In this case you can configure Juju to pull charms from an alternate source at controller creation time. Below, we create an OCI controller and pass the staging store URL:

``` text
juju bootstrap --config charmstore-url=https://api.staging.jujucharms.com/charmstore oci
```

<h3 id="heading--change-timeout-and-retry-delays">Change timeout and retry delays</h3>

You can change the default timeout and retry delays used by Juju by setting the following keys in your configuration:

<table style="width:82%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="40%" />
<col width="27%" />
<col width="13%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Key</th>
<th align="left">Default (seconds)</th>
<th align="left">Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">bootstrap-timeout</td>
<td align="left">600</td>
<td align="left">How long to wait for a connection to the controller</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">bootstrap-retry-delay</td>
<td align="left">5</td>
<td align="left">How long to wait between connection attempts to a controller</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">bootstrap-address-delay</td>
<td align="left">10</td>
<td align="left">How often to refresh controller addresses from the API server</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For example, to increase the timeout between the client and the controller from 10 minutes to 15, enter the value in seconds:

``` text
juju bootstrap --config bootstrap-timeout=900 localhost lxd-faraway
```

<h3 id="heading--create-a-new-controller-without-changing-contexts">Create a new controller without changing contexts</h3>

When a new controller is created, by default, the context will change to the 'default' model of that controller. In some cases (e.g. when scripting) this may not be desirable. The `--no-switch` option disables this behaviour:

``` text
juju bootstrap --no-switch localhost lxd-new
```

<h3 id="heading--configuringenabling-a-remote-syslog-server">Configuring/enabling a remote syslog server</h3>

Create an Azure controller and configure for log forwarding:

``` text
juju bootstrap azure --config logconfig.yaml
```

To enable forwarding on all the controller's models by default:

``` text
juju bootstrap azure --config logforward-enabled=true --config logconfig.yaml
```

See [Remote logging](/t/juju-logs/1184#heading--remote-logging) for a more thorough treatment of log forwarding.

<h3 id="heading--placing-a-controller-on-a-specific-maas-node">Placing a controller on a specific MAAS node</h3>

To create a controller and have it run on a specific MAAS node:

``` text
juju bootstrap maas-prod --to <host>.maas
```

<h3 id="heading--specifying-an-agent-version">Specifying an agent version</h3>

When a controller is created, it is possible to influence what agent version will be used across the controller and its models. This is covered in [Agent versions and streams](/t/configuring-models/1151#heading--agent-versions-and-streams).

<h3 id="heading--passing-a-cloud-specific-setting">Passing a cloud-specific setting</h3>

A cloud setting can be done locally or, since `v.2.6.0`, remotely (on a live cloud). Here, we'll show how to do it locally (client cache).

[note]
In versions prior to `v.2.6.0` the `show-cloud` command only operates locally (there is no `--local` option).
[/note]

View if your chosen backing cloud has any special features and then pass the feature as an option.

Firstly, reveal any features:

``` text
juju show-cloud --local --include-config aws
```

The bottom portion of the output looks like this:

``` text
The available config options specific to ec2 clouds are:
vpc-id:
  type: string
  description: Use a specific AWS VPC ID (optional). When not specified, Juju requires
    a default VPC or EC2-Classic features to be available for the account/region.
vpc-id-force:
  type: bool
  description: Force Juju to use the AWS VPC ID specified with vpc-id, when it fails
    the minimum validation criteria. Not accepted without vpc-id
```

[note]
The VPC ID is obtained from the AWS web UI.
[/note]

Secondly, create the controller by placing it (and its models) within it:

``` text
juju boootstrap --config vpc-id=vpc-86f7bbe1 aws
```

[note]
Cloud-specific features can also be passed to individual models during their creation (`add-model`).
[/note]

<h3 id="heading--include-configuration-options-at-the-cloud-level">Include configuration options at the cloud level</h3>

Any settings passed via the `--config` option can be included in the definition of a cloud. See [General cloud management](/t/clouds/1100#heading--general-cloud-management) for how to do this.
