The #interfaces category is a place for descriptions of relation interfaces.

### Rationale

Relation interfaces are poorly documented. They're confusing for new charm authors and that hampers the community's growth. 

### Using this category

The first step will be to document the status quo. What does a relation conversation look like? What does each side of the conversation send and receive?  

#### Future intentions

Once we have documented a few interfaces, we'll create documentation templates.

Over time, the category can be used to make decisions on changes to the protocol.
