Hello, 

As a newcomer to Juju I love the technology and it has massive potential, but I keep bumping into an issue with the docs.

This issue is that the docs seem to be blurred between juju user guides, and charm development - it feels as if some pages include the information required to be able to do something in juju, whilst others talk about how one can develop charms.

It would seem logical that these two topics would be better separated, maybe something like `dev.jujucharms.com` and `docs.jujucharms.com` to give a 'goto' place for developers, and people who just wish to deploy respectively.
