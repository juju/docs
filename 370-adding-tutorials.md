I have written a few tutorials I would like to add to the tutorials site. However, I'm hitting a wall trying to follow the guide to run the development site according to the instructions.

I've filed an issue: https://github.com/canonical-websites/tutorials.ubuntu.com/issues/881

Perhaps someone knows what I'm doing wrong or what the issue is.

I feel very dis-encouraged at the moment, having spent two days just trying to get the development environment up for writing a simple tutorial.

=== UPDATE (2018-11-11) ===
I have understood that there is a complimentary repo, https://github.com/ubuntu/tutorial-deployment, I need to dig into. The README in that repo is not clear to me how to use.

=== UPDATE (2018-11-13) ===
Lots of attention from the community on the topic. Haven't had more time to resolve the technical issues around getting the tutorial-tech-stack to work. Maybe in some time I'll find more time.
