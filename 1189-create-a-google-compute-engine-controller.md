Juju is unrivalled in its ability to model and deploy dependable cloud distributed applications. To prove this, we're going to use Juju to deploy one such application - [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) - with Google Compute Engine (GCE) in less than 10 minutes. But you could just as easily use Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, and just as easily deploy Kubernetes, Cassandra or even OpenStack. It's the magic of Juju that makes it happen.

<h2 id="heading--installation">Installation</h2>

First, install Juju, if you have not done so already. See [the install docs](/t/installing-juju/1164).

<h2 id="heading--pick-a-cloud">Pick a cloud</h2>

Type `juju clouds` and you'll see output very similar to the following:

``` text
Cloud           Regions  Default          Type        Description
aws                  15  us-east-1        ec2         Amazon Web Services
aws-china             2  cn-north-1       ec2         Amazon China
aws-gov               1  us-gov-west-1    ec2         Amazon (USA Government)
azure                27  centralus        azure       Microsoft Azure

localhost             1  localhost        lxd         LXD Container Hypervisor
```

As mentioned, we're going with Google's Cloud Engine, which we'll configure over the next couple of steps. But you could just as easily use [Amazon AWS](/t/using-amazon-aws-with-juju/1084) or [Microsoft Azure](/t/using-microsoft-azure-with-juju/1086), or any of the listed clouds you have credentials for.

<h2 id="heading--download-gce-credentials">Download GCE credentials</h2>

All you need to get started with GCE and Juju is a JSON-formatted credentials file for a new Compute Engine API-enabled project. Either sign up for a [free trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial), or connect to your [GCE dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com). If needed, see our GCE [Create a Project](/t/using-google-gce-with-juju/1088#create-a-project) documentation for further help.

<h2 id="heading--add-credentials">Add credentials</h2>

Copy the credentials file somewhere sensible, such as '~/.local/share/juju/gcejuju.json,' and initiate the import process by typing `juju add-credential google`. You'll first be asked for an arbitrary name to identify the credentials with, followed by a prompt asking for 'Auth Type'. Press return to select the default `jsonfile*` type and then enter the absolute path to the credentials file:

``` text
Enter credential name: juju-demo
Auth Types
jsonfile*
oauth2

Select auth-type:
Enter file: /home/graham/.local/share/juju/gcejuju.json
Credentials added for cloud google.
```

You can now start using Juju with your GCE cloud.

<h2 id="heading--bootstrap-juju">Bootstrap Juju</h2>

Pushing Juju onto your new cloud is as simple as typing:

``` text
juju bootstrap google mycloud
```

This should only take a few minutes. You could use this time to brush up on some [Juju terminology](/t/concepts-and-terms/1144).

<h2 id="heading--create-a-model">Create a model</h2>

Before deploying an application, we're going to first create a new model. Models are used by Juju to group applications, resources and their relationships into environments that can be seamlessly managed, deployed and scaled.

For example, different models can be deployed to different regions. You can see which regions your cloud supports with the `juju show-cloud google` command, and create a new model hosted on `us-east1` with the following:

``` text
juju add-model gce-test us-east1
```

<h2 id="heading--deploy-an-application">Deploy an application</h2>

Applications themselves are deployed either as 'charms' or as 'bundles'. Charms are singular applications, such as [Haproxy](https://jujucharms.com/haproxy/37) or [PostgreSQL](https://jujucharms.com/postgresql/105), whereas bundles are a curated collection of charms and their relationships. Bundles are ideal for deploying [OpenStack](https://jujucharms.com/openstack-base/), for instance, or [Kubernetes](https://jujucharms.com/canonical-kubernetes/).

It's also possible to [write your own charms](/t/getting-started-with-charm-development/1118) and deploy locally, or release via the [Charm Store](https://jujucharms.com/store).

Deploying a charm is as simple as searching for your required application on the [Charm Store](https://jujucharms.com/store), and using the 'juju' command to grab and deploy it automatically:

``` text
juju deploy haproxy
```

You can check on the state of any deployment, model or controller with the 'juju status' command. If you query the status directly after deploying 'haproxy', for instance, you'll something similar to this:

<!-- JUJUVERSION: 2.3.1-xenial-amd64 -->
<!-- JUJUCOMMAND: juju status -->
``` text
Model     Controller  Cloud/Region     Version  SLA
gce-test  mycloud     google/us-east1  2.3.1    unsupported

App      Version  Status   Scale  Charm    Store       Rev  OS      Notes

Relation provider  Requirer      Interface     Type  Message
haproxy:peer       haproxy:peer  haproxy-peer  peer
```

<h2 id="heading--use-jujus-gui">Use Juju's GUI</h2>

Juju includes a beautiful web interface. This allows you to perform almost all the same functions as the CLI, only without RSI. To launch the web interface in your default browser, type the following:

``` text
juju gui --browser
```

Then use the output username and password to connect to the GUI via your browser:

![Juju GUI login](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/72b6476b-tut-gce-gui_login280.png)

After logging in, you'll see the Juju GUI overview for the current model. Not only does the web interface show you the current state of your applications and their relationships, it allows you to manage your models, resources and machines, and deploy both charms and bundles.

For example, you can use the GUI to switch between the two models currently running on your controller - the default one we left empty and the new one we created for Haproxy. Look for the drop-down menu to the right of the user profile (which currently says 'admin'). In this drop-down list you should find both 'default' and 'gce-test' models, and selecting one will switch the current model.

<!-- REMOVED DUE TO INCONSISTENT BEHAVIOUR WITH JUJU 2.2.2
No app/model are visible in the GUI
![Juju GUI model switching menu](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/f83fac42-tut-gce-gui_model21.png)
 -->
To create a new model from the GUI, click on 'Profile' from the drop-down model list. This will open a more detailed list of the current models. A new model can now be created by clicking on the 'Create New' button at the top of the list, entering a name for the new model, and clicking submit. Click on 'Manage' for this model to return to the main view.

For more details on how to use Juju's web interface, take a look at [our overview](/t/juju-gui/1109).

<h2 id="heading--deploy-mediawiki-from-the-gui">Deploy MediaWiki from the GUI</h2>

With the blank canvas of a new model created, we're now in a position to deploy [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

From the GUI, this really is as simple as clicking on the link to the store and searching for `mediawiki`. There are currently two results returned, `MediaWiki` and 'MediaWiki Single'. The first result is MediaWiki on its own, while the second result is a bundle which also contains MySQL and the required pre-configured relationships to make MediaWiki work without any further configuration. Select the bundle then click on 'Add to [MODEL NAME]' to import the bundle into your model. Click on 'Commit changes' to review what's about to happen and finally 'Deploy'.

Monitor the GUI as the applications are deployed to GCE and when each application's colour changes from orange to grey, you're all set.

Congratulations - you've just modelled and deployed your own scalable cloud application.
