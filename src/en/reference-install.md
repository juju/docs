Title: Installing Juju

# Installing Juju

Stable versions of Juju are available on Ubuntu, various other Linux
distributions, macOS, and Windows. Development releases are also available for
testing.

## Version 2.5.1

The most recent stable version of Juju is 2.5.1. This is the version we
recommend for production use. See the [Release Notes][release-notes-2].

### Ubuntu

Since Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) the recommended way to install Juju is with
snaps. Nevertheless, the PPA install method is still supported and is mentioned
lower down.

On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (and greater) `snapd` is installed by default. If you're
using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you will need to install it prior to installing Juju:

```bash
sudo apt install snapd
```

!!! Note:
    A reboot will be needed after having installed `snapd` on Trusty since a
    new kernel (4.4.0 series) will be installed as a dependency.

Juju can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

In the above, the 'stable' snap channel is used by default.

The current version of an installed Juju snap is given by:

```bash
snap list juju
```

And can be updated with:

```bash
sudo snap refresh juju
```

See the [Snapcraft documentation][snapcraft-docs] for more information on
snaps. 

#### Using a PPA

To install the most recent stable version using a PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -yu ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt install juju
```

### CentOS and other Linuxes

Juju can be installed on various Linux distributions via snaps. On Ubuntu 
snapd comes pre-installed but if you're running something else you'll need to
visit [Install snapd][snapd-install] to get started.

You can now install Juju with:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

!!! Note:
    In the advent that option `--classic` is not supported on your chosen
    distro, use the `--devmode` option.

For CentOS, download Juju and install it manually: [**juju-2.5.1-centos7.tar.gz**][juju-centos] ([md5][juju-centos-md5])

### macOS

Install Juju on macOS with [Homebrew][homebrew]. Simply enter the following
into a terminal:

```bash
brew install juju
```

And upgrade Juju with the following:

```bash
brew upgrade juju
```

### Windows

For Windows, an installer is available: [**juju-setup-2.5.1-signed.exe**][juju-win-signed] ([md5][juju-win-signed-md5])

## Development releases

Development releases (alpha, beta, rc) are regularly published and we encourage
users to test these versions with real workloads and use cases. We kindly ask
you to [file a bug][juju-new-bug] when encountering an issue. Feedback on
usability and missing functionality is also very important to us.

### Using snaps

See [above][centos-and-other-linuxes] for how to get started with snaps if
you're running a non-Ubuntu Linux distro.

To install a development release using snaps, instead of the 'stable' channel,
use the 'beta' channel:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --beta --classic
```

For a cutting edge experience choose the 'edge' channel:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --edge --classic
```

To upgrade or downgrade, use the `refresh` command with a suitable channel.
Below we install 'edge' and then downgrade to 'beta':

```bash
sudo snap install juju --edge --classic
sudo snap refresh juju --beta
```

### Using a PPA

To install the development version using a PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -yu ppa:juju/devel
sudo apt install juju
```

!!! Note:
    The alpha builds are only available with snaps (via the 'edge' channel).

### Installing multiple Juju series

Some environments may see the need to run both the 1.x and the 2.x series
of Juju concurrently. See page
[Running multiple versions of Juju][juju-coexist] for guidance.

### Other platforms

All development release binaries are published on
[Launchpad][juju-launchpad-binaries]. Note that leading edge builds are only
available with snaps (via the 'edge' channel).

## Juju plugins

Juju functionality can be extended through the use of plugins. See the 
[Juju plugins][juju-plugins] page for information.

## Building from source

Refer to the [Contributing][contributing] documentation in the codebase for
instructions on how to build Juju from source.
