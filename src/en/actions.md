Title: Juju actions  

# Juju Actions

Juju charms can describe *actions* that users can take on deployed applications.

Actions are scripts that can be triggered on a unit via the CLI or the [Juju
GUI](controllers-gui.html). Parameters for an action are passed as a map,
either defined in a YAML file or given through the UI, and are validated
against the schema defined in actions.yaml. See
[Actions for the charm author](authors-charm-actions.html) for more
information.

The following commands are specified for dealing with actions:

`juju actions` - alias for list-actions  
`juju list actions` - list actions defined for a service  
`juju run-action` - queue an action for execution  
`juju show-action-output` - show output of an action by ID  
`juju show-action-status` - show status of all actions filtered by optional ID  

## Action commands

### `juju list-actions`

List the actions defined for a service.  

For example, with the 'git' charm deployed, you can see which actions it
supports with the following command:

```bash
juju list-actions git
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
add-repo: Create a git repository.
add-repo-user: Give a user permissions to access a repository.
add-user: Create a new user.
get-repo: Return the repository's path.
list-repo-users: List all users who have access to a repository.
list-repos: List existing git repositories.
list-user-repos: List all the repositories a user has access to.
list-users: List all users.
remove-repo: Remove a git repository.
remove-repo-user: Revoke a user's permissions to access a repository.
remove-user: Remove a user.
```

To show the full schema for all the actions on a service, append the `--schema`
argument to the `list-actions` command. For example, here's the beginning of
the output from `juju list-actions git --schema`:

```bash
add-repo:
  additionalProperties: false
  description: Create a git repository.
  properties:
    repo:
      description: Name of the git repository.
      type: string
  required:
  - repo
  title: add-repo
  type: object
...
```

!!! Note: that the full schema is under the `properties` key of the root Action.
Juju Actions rely on [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org) for validation.
The top-level keys shown for the Action (`description` and `properties`) may
include future additions to the feature.

### `juju run-action`

Trigger an action. This command takes the unit as an argument and returns an ID
for the action. The ID can be used with `juju show-action-output <ID>` or `juju
show-action-status <ID>.

If an action requires parameters, these can be passed directly. For example, we
could create a new 'git' repository by triggering the 'add-repo' action and
following this with the name we'd like to give the new repository:


```bash
juju run-action git/0 add-repo repo=myproject
```
This will return the ID for the new action:

```bash
Action queued with id: 3a7cc626-4c4c-4f00-820f-f881b79586d10
```

You can also set parameters indirectly via a YAML file, although you can
override the parameters within the file by providing them directly.

*Example params.yml:*
```yaml
repo: myproject
sure: no
```
With the above example `params.yaml` file, we could remove the `myproject` git repository
with the following command:

```bash
juju run-action git/0 remove-repo --params=params.yaml sure=yes
```

### `juju show-action-output`

Shows the results returned from an action with the given ID. To
see the output from the `add-repo` action we executed earlier, for example,
we'd enter the following:

```bash
juju show-action-output 3a7cc626-4c4c-4f00-820f-f881b79586d10
```
This will return something like the following:
```bash
results:
  dir: /var/git/myproject.git
status: completed
timing:
  completed: 2016-05-10 09:43:40 +0000 UTC
  enqueued: 2016-05-10 09:43:36 +0000 UTC
  started: 2016-05-10 09:43:39 +0000 UTC
```

### `juju show-action-status`

Query the status of an action. For example, We could check on the progress of git's
`add-repo` action with the following command:

```bash
juju show-action-status 3a7cc626-4c4c-4f00-820f-f881b79586d1
```
This will output the status of the action, shown here as 'completed':

```bash
actions:
- id :3a7cc626-4c4c-4f00-820f-f881b79586d1
  status: completed
  unit: git/0
```
