Title:Creating icons for charms

# Creating icons for charms

In order to make your charm recogniseable in the Charm Store, it is best
practice to add a unique and recogniseable icon for it. This isn't as hard as it
may seem, as this step by step guide will demonstrate:

## Icon specifications

Before we start actually making the icon though, we should be aware of the
specifications required by the charm store. This is to ensure a consistent
experience for the users, and icons failing to meet this spec will be rejected.

A charm icon is an SVG format image where the canvas size is 96x96 pixels. It
consists of a squircle (a square with rounded corners) which looks ‘embossed’ in
the UI. A unique pictogram (usually monochromatic) is displayed in the middle of
the squircle.

The squircle can be filled with either a flat color or a vertical gradient. In
case of a gradient, the darker colour should correspond to the bottom of the
shape, because of the light source located above the icon.

There is no specification to design the pictogram: it can be a white (or black)
monochromatic symbol, a colored logo, or whatever is best. However, remember to
respect a 16-pixels padding between the edges of the canvas and the pictogram.

If you do not provide an icon for your charm, the icon of the category
associated with your charm will be used as placeholder:

## Creating an icon

If meeting the above spec seems more complicated than creating your charm in the
first place, then fear not, because we have an easy step-by-step guide for you.
Before you start you will need:

  - A vector graphic editor. We strongly recommend the cross-platform and most excellent [ Inkscape ](http://www.inkscape.org) for all your vector graphic needs.
  - The template file, [ which you can download from this link ](./media/icon.svg)
  - An existing logo you can import, or the ability to draw one in Inkscape

Once you have those, fire up Inkscape and we can begin!

## Open the template!

From Inkscape load the **icon.svg** file. Select the Layer called "BACKGROUND",
either from the drop down at the bottom, or from the layer dialog.

## Add colour

Select **Object** and then **Fill and Stroke** from the menu to adjust the colour. Apply a
flat colour or a gradient, but make sure you edit the gradient file to make it
lighter at the top and darker at the bottom.

## Show the guides

Choose the "PICTOGRAM" layer, which is where your logo will live. To help you
place it properly, choose **View&GT;Guides** from the menu. A grid will appear
showing the limits of the pictogram area.

## Draw something

Draw your shape within the bounds determined by the guides. If you already have
a vector logo, you can import it and scale it within the guides. Inkscape also
has plenty of drawing tools for creating complex images.

If you import a bitmap image to use, be sure to convert it into a vector file
and delete the bitmap.

## Add a shadow

If you want to apply a drop shadow to your design to make it stand out from the
background a bit more, there is a quick filter to help. Choose
**Filter&GT;Filter Editor** from the menu and select "Drop shadow" from the
list.

## Check it over

You can check what your icon might look like with the reviewed badge by making
the "BADGE"layer visible. Make sure you hide it again before saving out the SVG
file. Congratulations, your shiny icon is now ready!

## And finally... some quick Dos and Don'ts

Icons should not be overly complicated. Charm icons are displayed in various
sizes (from 160x160 to 32x32 pixels) and they should be always legible. In
Inkscape, the ‘Icon preview’ tool can help you to check the sharpness of your
icons at small sizes.

Do not invert or rotate the background gradient - it just looks wrong when the
other icons will all have consistent gradients.

Symbols should have a similar weight on all icons: avoid too thin strokes and
use the whole space available to draw the symbol within the limits defined by
the padding. However, if the symbol is much wider than it is high, it may
overflow onto the horizontal padding area to ensure its weight is consistent.

Do not use glossy materials unless they are parts of a logo that you are not
allowed to modify.
