# Running multiple versions of Juju

You may wish to use the 2.x series of Juju for new projects, tests, or
development work, but still require to support legacy deployments, which use
the 1.x series. It is possible to install both series on the same host but how
it's done depends on your OS.

The data directory for 1.x is `~/.juju` and for 2.x it is
`~/.local/share/juju/`. Keep these as-is; do not attempt to co-locate files in
a central directory.

The instructions given in this guide must be followed by a user logout, login,
and a verification of what series is associated with the called binary. For
example, if the called binary is `juju-1` then a verification consists of:

```bash
juju-1 version
```

!!! Note:
    On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) the 1.x series is not available.

## Ubuntu and 2.x

On Ubuntu, install 2.x using [these][install-ubuntu] standard instructions.

## Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) and 1.x

On Xenial, how to install 1.x depends on which series you want to be the
default binary.

### To make 2.x be the default

To let 2.x be the default install 1.x with the following deb:

```bash
sudo apt install juju-1.25
```

Here, `juju` will call 2.x and `juju-1` will call 1.x.

### To make 1.x be the default

To let 1.x be the default install 1.x with this deb:

```bash
sudo apt install juju-1-default
```

Now, `juju` will call 1.x and `/snap/bin/juju` will call 2.x.

## Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) and 1.x

On Trusty, there is only one way to install 1.x:

```bash
sudo apt install juju
```

### To make 2.x be the default

There's no fancy way to make 2.x be called by `juju` by default.

Edit your PATH environment variable so that `/snap/bin` appears before
`/usr/bin`. For the Bash shell, one way is to add a line at the bottom of
`~/.profile`. For example:

```no-highlight
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/snap/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

To fully reflect the corresponding Xenial scenario, you can create a symbolic
link for the 1.x series:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/juju /usr/bin/juju-1
```

After these changes, `juju` will call 2.x and `juju-1` will call 1.x.

### To make 1.x be the default

In this scenario, by default, `juju` will call 1.x and `/snap/bin/juju` will
call 2.x.

## Other Linux 

The CentOS download, available [here][install-centos], includes the binaries
for Juju which should also work on other flavours of Linux. As these tarballs
simply contain an executable binary, you can place them wherever you wish,
renaming them if required.

It is recommended to install them in `/usr/lib/juju-1.25/bin` and
`/usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin`. After which you can use `Ã¹pdate-alternatives` to
configure which one to use:

```bash
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju juju /usr/lib/juju-2.0/bin/juju 1
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/juju juju /usr/lib/juju-1.25/bin/juju 0
update-alternatives --config juju
```

The same data directories as noted above for Ubuntu are created on first
use of the Juju binary.

## Windows

The latest Windows version of Juju can be downloaded from
[here][install-windows].

Unlike Linux and OS X binary releases, the Microsoft Windows version of Juju is
bundled within an executable installer. Running this will walk you through a
GPL licence agreement, a request for an install location and the opportunity to
add this install location to your environment path. 

By default, a new installation will upgrade any previous installation. If you
wish to install two versions alongside one another, such as versions 1.25 and
2.0, you will need to install the first package without specifying an
environment path. This will stop the second installation automatically
overwriting the first. You can then specify a different install location for
the second installation and either manually rename and add the binaries to your
Windows environment path, or run each executable directly from their respective
directories.

Juju can be uninstalled from the Windows 'Add or remove programs' system pane,
just like any other Windows application.

## macOS

The Apple OS X download, available [here][install-macos], includes the binaries
for Juju. These will work work with any recent version of Mac OS X, including
10.9 (Mavericks), 10.10 (Yosemite), 10.11 (El Capitan) and 10.12 (Sierra).

As the download tarball contains executable binaries, you can place them
wherever you wish within your user's shell path (such as `/usr/bin`), renaming
them or their parent folders if required. Renaming is particularly useful if
you want to install two versions of Juju alongside one another, such as
versions 1.25 and 2.5, as the binary files within each archive have identical
names. 

Unfortunately, OS X doesn't currently support a system similar to
`update-alternatives` (see above), which means you'll need to manually update
and name the files differently when installing and using multiple versions.
