## Get Juju

The easiest way to install Juju is by using the `snap` package:

	  sudo snap install juju --classic

Those already using the 'stable' snap channel (the default as per the above
command) should be upgraded automatically. Other packages are available for a
variety of platforms (see the [install documentation][reference-install]).
