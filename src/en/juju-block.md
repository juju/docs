Title: Disabling commands
TODO:  Table needs verification

# Disabling commands

Commands can be disabled on a per-model basis. This is to protect the model
from unintentional changes. This is accomplished through the use of the
`disable-command` command with one of three progressively restrictive command
groups:

 - destroy-model
 - remove-object
 - all

By disabling the `destroy-model` group, for instance, users lose the ability to
destroy both the model and its controller. Specifying the `remove-object` group
adds to these restrictions by disabling the removal of machines, relations,
applications, and units. The `all` group disables the complete set of commands
that can change the configuration of a model.

To give users an idea as to why a command is disabled, an optional message
argument can be passed.

For example, to prevent execution of both the `destroy-model` and
`destroy-controller` commands:

```bash
juju disable-command destroy-model "Check with SA before destruction."
```

If a user now attempts to destroy a protected model, they'd encounter an error
similar to the following:

```no-highlight
Destroying model
ERROR cannot destroy model: Check with SA before destruction.

destroy-model operation has been disabled for the current model.
To enable the command run

    juju enable-command destroy-model
```

!!! Important: 
    The `--force` option supported by some commands overrides disabled
    commands.

## Re-enabling a command

To re-enable a command the `enable-command` is used.

For example, to restore the commands associated with the 'destroy-model'
command group:

```bash
juju enable-command destroy-model
```
  
As usual, these actions are performed against the currently selected
controller and model.

To list which commands have been disabled, use `disabled-commands`:

```bash
juju disabled-commands
``` 

This will output will list any group that's currently disabled:

<!-- JUJUVERSION: 2.0.1-xenial-amd64 -->
<!-- JUJUCOMMAND: juju disabled-commands -->
```no-highlight
Disabled commands  Message
all
```

!!! Note: 
    In some cases, the disable command will only take effect after the user has
    logged out of Juju (`juju logout`) and logged back in again (`juju login`).
