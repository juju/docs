# Using Rackspace with Juju

Juju already has knowledge of the Rackspace cloud, so unlike previous versions there
is no need to provide a specific configuration for it, it 'just works'. Rackspace
will appear in the list of known clouds when you issue the command:

```bash
juju clouds
```
And you can see more specific information (e.g. the supported regions and
authentication types) by running:

```bash
juju show-cloud rackspace
```
If at any point you believe Juju's information is out of date (e.g. Rackspace just
announced support for a new region), you can update Juju's public cloud data by
running:

```bash
juju update-clouds
```

## Adding credentials

The [Cloud credentials][credentials] page offers a full treatment of credential
management.

Using Juju's interactive authentication, importing Rackspace credentials into
Juju is a simple process. The only information you'll need is your Rackspace
username, password and tenant name (which is actually a number):

 - **`username`** The name used to login to the Rackspace cloud control panel.

 - **`password`** The password used to login to the Rackspace cloud
   control panel.

 - **`tenant-name`** The Rackspace account number. You can view this in
    the cloud control panel in the top-right corner (under your username), as
    shown in the following image:

Credentials can now be added by running the following command:

```bash
juju add-credential rackspace
```

The first question will ask for an arbitrary credential name, which you choose
for yourself. This will be how you remember and refer to this Rackspace
credential in Juju. The second question will ask you to select an 'Auth Type',
with the options being either `access-key` or `userpass`.

Enter `userpass` as the authentication type and then enter your username,
password and tenant-name, as described above.

You can now start using Juju with your Rackspace cloud.

## Creating a controller

You are now ready to create a Juju controller for cloud 'rackspace':

```bash
juju bootstrap rackspace rackspace-controller
```

Above, the name given to the new controller is 'rackspace-controller'.
Rackspace will provision an instance to run the controller on.

The controller will now be visible in the
[Rackspace cloud control panel][rscontrolpanel]:

For a detailed explanation and examples of the `bootstrap` command see the
[Creating a controller][controllers-creating] page.

## Next steps

A controller is created with two models - the 'controller' model, which
should be reserved for Juju's internal operations, and a model named
'default', which can be used for deploying user workloads.

See these pages for ideas on what to do next:
