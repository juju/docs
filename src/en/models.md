Title: Juju models
TODO:  Convert to abstract links


# Juju models

A Juju *model* is an environment associated with a *controller* (see
[Controllers](./controllers.html)). When a controller is created two models are
provisioned along with it. These initial models are named 'controller' and
'default'. The 'controller' model is for internal Juju management and is not
intended for general workloads. The 'default' model, however, is ready for
immediate use. Models can be added easily at any time.

## Model management

Common model management tasks are summarized below.



^# View model status
   
   Use the `juju status` command to view the status of a model:

   `juju status [options] [filter pattern ...]`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#status) or the `juju help
   status` command.
   


^# Add a model
  
   Use the `juju add-model` command to add a model to a controller:
   
   `juju add-model [options] <model name> [key=[value] ...]`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#add-model) or the `juju help
   add-model` command.
  


^# List all models

   Use the `juju models` command to list all models for a controller:
   
   `juju models [options]`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#models) or the `juju help
   models` command.
  


^# Examine a model

   Use the `juju show-model` command to examine a specific model:
   
   `juju show-model [options]`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#show-model) or the
   `juju help show-model` command.



^# Configure a model

   Configuration can occur at the model level. This will affect all Juju
   machines in the model. For instance, a logging level and API port can be
   stipulated.

   This is a complex subject. See [Model configuration](./models-config.html).



^# Set constraints for a model

   Charm constraints can be managed at the model level. This will affect all
   charms used in the model unless overridden by constraints set at the
   application level. Constraints are used to select minimum requirements for any
   future machines Juju may create. For instance, a constraint may be set so that
   machines have a minimum amount of disk space on their root drive.

   This is a complex subject. See
   [Using constraints](./charms-constraints.html#setting-constraints-for-a-model).
   


^# Destroy a model

   Use the `juju destroy-model` command to remove a model from a controller:
   
   `juju destroy-model [options] <model name>`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#destroy-model) or the `juju help
   destroy-model` command.
   


^# Change models
   
   Use the `juju switch` command to go from one model to another:
   
   `juju switch [<controller or model>|<:model>|<controller>:<model>|<controller:>]`
   
   Running the command with no arguments will return the currently active 
   controller and model:
     
         juju switch
   
   To change to a model:
   
   `juju switch foo`  
   Selects the last used model in controller 'foo' (if the latter exists),
   otherwise model 'foo' in the current controller.

   `juju switch :foo`  
   Selects model 'foo' in the current controller.

   `juju switch foo:bar`  
   Selects model 'bar' in controller 'foo'.
   
   `juju switch foo:`  
   Selects the last used model in controller 'foo'

   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#switch) or the `juju help switch`
   command.
   

^# Migrate models

   Use the `juju migrate` command to move a model from one controller to
   another. This is useful for load balancing when a controller is too busy, or
   as a way to upgrade a model's controller to a newer Juju version.

   `juju migrate [options] <model name> <target controller name>`

   For a complete explanation, see [migrating models](./models-migrate.html),
   the [command reference page](./commands.html#migrate) or the `juju help
   migrate` command.
   
   

^# Provide SSH access
   
   Use the `juju add-ssh-key` and `juju import-ssh-key` commands to provide SSH
   access to all machines, present and future, in a model:
   
   `juju add-ssh-key <ssh-key>`

   OR

   `juju import-ssh-key <lp|gh>:<user identity>`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#add-ssh-key) or the
   `juju help add-ssh-key` or the `juju help import-ssh-key` commands.
   


^# List SSH access keys
   
   Use the `juju ssh-keys` command to list SSH keys currently permitting
   access to all machines, present and future, in a model:
   
   `juju ssh-keys [options]`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#ssh-keys) or the `juju help
   ssh-keys` command.
   


^# Remove SSH access
   
   Use the `juju remove-ssh-key` command to remove SSH access to all machines,
   present and future, from a model:
   
   `juju remove-ssh-key <ssh-key-id> ...`
   
   For complete explanation and syntax, see the
   [command reference page](./commands.html#remove-ssh-key) or the `juju help
   remove-ssh-key` command.
   
   

^# Grant and revoke user access
   
   This topic is treated in
   [Users and models](./users-models.html#models-and-user-access).



^# View logs

   Juju logs are viewed at the model level. This allows inspection of
   activities occuring on multiple Juju machines simultaneously. Due to the
   expected large volume of data, advanced filtering is available.

   This is a complex subject. See [Juju logs](./troubleshooting-logs.html).



^# Upgrade a model
   
   Juju software is upgraded at the model level. This affects the Juju agents
   running on every machine Juju creates. This upgrade process does not pertain
   to the Juju software package installed on a client system.

   This is a complex subject. See [Model upgrades](./models-upgrade.html).



^# Cross model relations
   
   Traditionally, when adding a relation between two applications (see
   [Charm relations](./charms-relations.html)) the applications reside within
   the same model and controller. It is possible, however, to break out of this
   paradigm by employing *cross model relations*.

   This is a complex subject. See [Cross model relations](./models-cmr.html).
