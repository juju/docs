Title: Models

# Models

A *model* is an environment associated with a controller. When a controller is
created two models are provisioned along with it. These initial models are
named 'controller' and 'default'. The 'controller' model is for internal Juju
management and is not intended for general workloads. The 'default' model,
however, is ready for immediate use. Models can be added easily at any time.

## Model management

Common model management tasks are summarised below.

The most important ones are [Adding a model][models-adding] and
[Configuring models][models-config].


^# Add a model
  
   Models can be easily added to a controller.
   
   The [Adding a model][models-adding] page provides a full explanation and
   includes examples.


^# Change models
   
   Use the `switch` command to change from one model to another:
   
   Running the command with no arguments will return the currently active 
   controller and model:
     
   `juju switch`
   
   To change to a model:
   
   `juju switch foo`  
   Selects the last used model in controller 'foo' (if the latter exists),
   otherwise model 'foo' in the current controller.

   `juju switch :foo`  
   Selects model 'foo' in the current controller.

   `juju switch foo:bar`  
   Selects model 'bar' in controller 'foo'.
   
   `juju switch foo:`  
   Selects the last used model in controller 'foo'

   For command line help and syntax run `juju help switch`.


^# Compare a bundle to a model

   An operator can compare a model with a charm bundle. This is useful for
   determining what has changed since the bundle was deployed or just how a
   model differs from a bundle that was not yet used.
   
   This topic is covered on the [Charm bundles][charms-bundles-diff] page.


^# Configure a model

   Configuration can occur at the model level. This will affect all Juju
   machines in the model. For instance, a logging level and API port can be
   stipulated.

   See the [Configuring models][models-config] page for explanations.


^# Cross model relations
   
   Traditionally, when adding a relation between two applications (see
   [Charm relations][charms-relations]) the applications reside within the same
   model and controller. It is possible to overcome this limitation by
   employing *cross model relations*.

   This topic is covered on the [Cross model relations][models-cmr] page.


^# Destroy a model

   When a model is destroyed all associated applications and machines are
   also destroyed. It is a very destructive process.


^# Disable commands

   It is possible to curtail command use for Juju users on a per-model basis.
   
   The [Disabling commands][juju-block] page gives more information.


^# Examine a model

   Use the `show-model` command to examine a specific model.
   
   For command line help and syntax run `juju help show-model`.


^# List all models

   Use the `models` command to list all models for a controller.
   
   For command line help and syntax run `juju help models`.


^# Manage user access
   
   If you're using multiple Juju users you will need to manage access to your
   models. See page [Working with multiple users][multiuser] for a full
   explanation.
   

^# Migrate models

   Model can be migrated from one controller to another. Model migration is
   useful when upgrading a controller and for load balancing.

   For a complete explanation see the [Migrating models][models-migrate] page.
   

^# SSH access
   
   SSH access can be provided to all machines, present and future, on a
   per-model basis.
   
   For in-depth coverage see page [Machine authentication][machine-auth].


^# Set constraints for a model

   Charm constraints can be managed at the model level. This will affect all
   charms used in the model unless overridden. Constraints are used to select
   minimum requirements for any future machines Juju may create.

   This subject is covered on page 
   [Setting constraints for a model][charms-constraints-models].


^# Upgrade a model
   
   Juju software is upgraded at the model level with the `upgrade-model`
   command. This affects the Juju agents running on every machine Juju creates.
   This does not pertain to the Juju software package installed on a client
   system.

   See [Upgrading models][models-upgrade] for complete coverage.


^# View logs
   
   Use the `debug-log` command to examine logs on a per-model basis. This
   allows inspection of activities occurring on multiple Juju machines
   simultaneously. Due to the expected large volume of data, advanced filtering
   is available.

   A full explanation is provided on the [Juju logs][juju-logs] page.


^# View model status
   
   Use the `status` command to view the status of a model.

   For command line help and syntax run `juju help status`.
