Title: Charm tools  

The 'Charm Tools' Juju Plugin is a collection of commands enabling users
and charm authors to create, search, fetch, update, and
manage charms.

# Installation

tools package from this PPA:

# Usage

Charm Tools comes packaged as both a stand alone tool and a juju plugin. For the
sake of documentation purposes, the plugin syntax, `juju charm`, is shown. If
you wish to use the stand alone client, or don't have juju installed, you can
replace all instances of `juju charm` with just `charm`.

There are several tools available within charm tools itself. At any time you can
run `juju charm` to view the available subcommands and all subcommands have
independent help pages, accessible using either the `-h` or `--help` flags.

^# add

      juju charm add [-h|--help] tests,readme,icon [CHARM_DIRECTORY]

  Add is a generator function which can be used to extend a charm depending on
  the subcommand issued:

  ### icon

  `icon` will create an `icon.svg` in the `CHARM_DIRECTORY`. This icon is
  a template and should be customised by the charm author (see 
  [Charm Icons documentation](authors-charm-icon.html)).

  ### readme

  `readme` will create a `README.ex` in the `CHARM_DIRECTORY` from the template
  charm.

  ### tests

  `tests` will create a tests directory for a charm and generate an example test
  using the Amulet framework. This command will ingest relation data from the
  charm `metadata.yaml` and create test file, `00-autogen`, based on matching
  charms to the interfaces listed. This is merely an example to start with and
  will need to be modified.


^# create


      juju charm create [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-a] [-v] <charmname> [charmhome]


  The `create` command will produce a new boilerplate charm. Replace `<charmname>`
  with the name of your new charm. A directory called `<charmname>` will be created
  in the `[charmhome]` directory, or your current directory if no `[charmhome]`
  directory is provided.

  By default, your new charm is created using the python template. Use the
  `-t TEMPLATE` option to create a charm using a different template, e.g.:

      juju charm create -t bash my-charm
 

  To see the list of installed templates use `juju charm create -h`.

  Depending on the template being used, `juju charm create` may prompt for
  user input. To suppress prompts and accept all defaults instead, use the
  `-a` or `--accept-defaults` option.

  ### Create Options

    - `-h`, `--help`: Show help.
    - `-t`, `--template`: The template to use when creating the charm.
    - `-a`, `--accept-defaults`: If the chosen template prompts for user
      input, suppress all prompts and accept the defaults instead.
    - `-v`, `--verbose`: Show debug output.

  ### Bash Example
 
      juju charm create -t bash my-charm
 
  will create the following charm structure:

        my-charm
        ├── config.yaml
        ├── hooks
        │   ├── config-changed
        │   ├── install
        │   ├── relation-name-relation-broken
        │   ├── relation-name-relation-changed
        │   ├── relation-name-relation-departed
        │   ├── relation-name-relation-joined
        │   ├── start
        │   ├── stop

        ├── icon.svg
        ├── metadata.yaml
        ├── README.ex
        └── revision
 

  ### Python Example

      juju charm create -t python my-charm

  will create the following structure:

        my-charm/
        ├── charm-helpers.yaml
        ├── config.yaml
        ├── hooks
        │   ├── config-changed

            └── 10-deploy



^# get

      juju charm get [-h|--help] CHARM_NAME [CHARMS_DIRECTORY]

  If you want to branch one of the charm store charms, use the `get` command
  specifying the `CHARM_NAME` you want to copy and provide an optional
  `CHARMS_DIRECTORY`. Otherwise the current directory will be used

  For example:

      juju charm get mysql

  Will download the MySQL charm to a mysql directory within your current path.

      juju charm get wordpress ~/charms/precise/


  Will download the WordPress charm to `~/charms/precise/wordpress`


^# getall

      juju charm getall [-h|--help] [CHARMS_DIRECTORY]

  Similar to `get`, `getall` will fetch all official charm store charms and place
  them in the `CHARMS_DIRECTORY`, or your current directory if no
  `CHARMS_DIRECTORY` is provided. This command can take quite a while to complete
  - there are a lot of charms!


^# info

      juju charm info [-h|--help] CHARM

  Info is used to query the README file for a charm. This command accepts various
  forms of a valid "charm id". Any ID that can be used to deploy a charm with
  `juju deploy`, with the exception of `local:`, can be used with this command.

  For example, this will print the raw README for the WordPress charm:

      juju charm info wordpress


^# list
 
      juju charm list [-h|--help]


  Show all charms (both official and personal) in the charm store. This produces
  an exhaustive list of all charms available in the store.

^# promulgate

 
      juju charm promulgate [-h|--help] [-b|--branch] [-s|--series] [-v|--verbose] [-u|--unpromulgate] [-f|--force] [-w|--ignore-warnings] [-o|--owner-branch] CHARM_DIRECTORY


  Promulgate is used to promote a charm to the charm store. This command is only
  available to users in the ~charmers group and is meant to be run only after a
  charm passes the review process. `CHARM_DIRECTORY` is the path to the charm to
  be promulgated. When promulgating `proof` is run and unless otherwise forced,
  will prevent promulgation if errors occur.

  ### Promulgate Options

    - `-b`, `--branch`: The location of the charm public branch. Will be
      determined from the bzr configuration if omitted.
    - `-s`, `--series`: The distribution series on which to set the official 
      branch. Defaults to setting it in the current development series (LTS).
    - `-v`, `--verbose`: Increase verbosity level.
    - `-u`, `--unpromulgate`: Un-promulgate this branch instead of promulgating
      it.
    - `-f`, `--force`: Override warnings and errors. USE WITH EXTREME CARE!
    - `-w`, `--ignore-warnings`: Promulgate this branch even with warnings from
      charm proof.
    - `-o`, `--owner-branch`: Promulgate a branch owned by a someone/group other
      than ~charmers.

^# proof

 
      juju charm proof CHARM_DIRECTORY
 
  Proof is designed to perform a "lint" against a charms structure to validate if
  it conforms to what the Charm Store thinks a charm structure and layout should
  be. `proof` will provide output at varying levels of severity. `I` is
  informational - these are things a charm could do but don't currently. `W` is a
  warning - these are items that violate charm store policy or have an adverse affect
  on tools in the juju ecosystem. `E` is an error - these are items that are major
  and will result in a broken charm. Any charm with a Warning or Error will not
  pass charm store review policy.

^# review-queue

      juju charm review-queue [-h|--help]

  This provides a copy of the
  [juju charms review queue](http://review.juju.solutions) which is used by 
  ~charmers to identify which charms are available for review.


^# search

      juju charm search [-h|--help] <text>


  This command will search the charm repository (including namespace charms) for 
  matching charms, and return a list showing their Launchpad identifier.

  For example: 
 
      juju charm search kafka


  might return:

      lp:~arosales/charms/trusty/kafka/trunk
      lp:~bigdata-dev/charms/trusty/apache-kafka/trunk
      lp:~hazmat/charms/trusty/kafka/trunk
      lp:~merlijn-sebrechts/charms/precise/kafka/trunk
      lp:~samuel-cozannet/charms/trusty/kafka-twitter/trunk
      lp:~samuel-cozannet/charms/trusty/kafka/trunk
      lp:~vpalos/charms/bundles/kafka-storm/bundle
      lp:~vpalos/charms/trusty/kafka/trunk
      lp:~x3v947pl/charms/trusty/kafka-dh/trunk
 

^# unpromulgate

      juju charm unpromulgate [-h|--help] [-f|--force]
  This is simply a convenience method to running `juju charm promulgate
  --unpromulgate`.

^# update

 
      juju charm update [-h|--help] [-f|--fix] [CHARMS_DIRECTORY]
 

  Update is used for `CHARMS_DIRECTORY`, when `CHARMS_DIRECTORY` is a repository
  created via `getall`
