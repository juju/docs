# Configuring for Joyent Cloud 

This process requires you to have a Joyent account. If you
have not signed up for one yet, it can obtained at
[http://www.joyent.com/](http://www.joyent.com/).

You should start by generating a generic configuration file for Juju, using the
command:

    juju generate-config

This will generate a file, `environments.yaml`, which will live in your
`~/.juju/` directory (and will create the directory if it doesn't already
exist).

**Note:** If you have an existing configuration, you can use `juju generate-config --show` to output the new config file, then copy and paste relevant areas in a text editor etc.

The generic configuration sections generated for Joyent will look something like
this:

    joyent:
      type: joyent
    
      # SDC config
      # Can be set via env variables, or specified here
      # sdc-user: <secret>
      # Can be set via env variables, or specified here
      # sdc-key-id: <secret>
      # url defaults to us-west-1 DC, override if required
      # sdc-url: https://us-west-1.api.joyentcloud.com
    
      # Manta config
      # Can be set via env variables, or specified here
      # manta-user: <secret>
      # Can be set via env variables, or specified here
      # manta-key-id: <secret>
      # url defaults to us-east DC, override if required
      # manta-url: https://us-east.manta.joyent.com
    
      # Auth config
      # private-key-path is the private key used to sign Joyent requests.
      # Defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa, override if a different ssh key is used.
      # Alternatively, you can supply "private-key" with the content of the private
      # key instead supplying the path to a file.
      # private-key-path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      # algorithm defaults to rsa-sha256, override if required
      # algorithm: rsa-sha256

This is a simple configuration intended to run on Joyent with Manta storage. Values for the default settings can be changed simply by editing this file, uncommenting the relevant lines and adding your own settings. All you need to do to get Juju deploying services on Joyent is to set:

- `sdc-user` (Joyent login username)
- `sdc-key-id` (finger print from ssh key uploaded to Joyent)
- `manta-user` (login username -same as `sdc-user`)
- `manta-key-id` (finger print from uploaded ssh key -same as `sdc-key-id`)
- `private-key-path` (if your private is not at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)

**Note:** If you are having issues with `private-key-path` suggest to paste your Joyent _matching_ private key directly under the `private-key` value. Remember to indent properly and to append a `|` after `private-key` to span multiple lines.

You can retrieve these values easily from Joyent Dashboard  at
[https://my.joyent.com/main/#!/account](https://my.joyent.com). Click on your
name in the top-right and then the "Account" link from the drop
down menu.
