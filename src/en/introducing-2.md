# Introducing Juju 2.0

If you are familiar with Juju, you are no doubt excited to get started with the
wealth of powerful new features introduced in the new 2.0 release (and if you 
haven't tried Juju before, see [this introduction][aboutjuju]). But 
what are the new features? What has changed? 

This page will give you an overview of the significant changes that you really
need to know about before you do anything else.
You can also review the [complete release notes here][releasenotes].

 - **Commands:** Probably the most immediate change you will come across is that
practically every command has changed! Really! Significant work has been done to
make the commands more consistent, logical and easy to understand. For example, 
instead of `juju authorised-keys add <xxxx>` you will now use the command
`juju add-ssh-key <xxxx>`.
It reads better, is more straightforward, and 
works really well with tab completion! The documentation has been updated to
include all these new commands, so you can check relevant pages for guides to
the new commands, or browse through the [reference guide][referenceguide].
There is also a handy [crib sheet][commandchanges] to show you the new
versions of old commands.

 - **Terminology:** You are probably used to thinking of Juju in terms of the 
bootstrap node (state server) and environments. You will now find that the 
documentation talks about "Controllers" and "models" instead. Why? Part of this
is to do with the way Juju organises itself - now multiple models (environments)
can be driven from one controller (state-server). This means that for a given
cloud you only need one controller, but can drive several models.

 - **Providers:** As well as updates to the Azure provider and 
the new Rackspace provider, Juju now makes extensive use of LXD. This makes 'local' 
models leaner and faster and also brings benefits to placing containers within 
models. Find out more by reading the [Using LXD with Juju][clouds-lxd] page.

 - **Configless clouds:** Why fill out loads of configuration info about
public clouds when you don't have to? Juju now ships with 'baked-in' 
knowledge of a range of clouds - just provide your credentials (with the help
of all-new interactive tools) and you're off!

 - **Users and sharing:** Don't keep it to yourself - Juju 2.0 supports 
multi-user access to controllers and models. [Follow the tutorial][users] or
read up on all the related commands [here][user-guide]
 
## Upgrading from earlier versions

At the current time, there is no upgrade path from Juju 1.x to Juju 2.x

However, both versions of Juju can co-exist on Ubuntu, so you can continue 
to operate legacy systems and still use the powerful new features of 2.0.
Please see the [additional information][coexist] on running multiple versions 
of Juju.
