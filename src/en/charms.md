Title: Introduction to Juju Charms


# Introduction to Juju Charms

The magic behind Juju is a collection of software components called *Charms*.
They contain all the instructions necessary for deploying and configuring
cloud-based services. The charms publicly available in the online
[Charm Store](authors-charm-store.html) represent the distilled DevOps knowledge
of experts. If you cannot find what you're looking for or if what's available
does not suit your needs then you are free to write your own.

Charms make it easy to reliably and repeatedly deploy services.  The
[Juju walkthrough](./getting-started.html) is a quick-start guide that
provides a practical overview of using Juju.

Generally, you follow a simple three-step procedure: deploy, configure, and
expose services. The sub-sections in the left navigation pane under **Juju
Charms** explore in detail this procedure in addition to the everyday operations
you are likely to perform as you work with Juju Charms.
