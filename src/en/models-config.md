Title: Configuring models
TODO: Check accuracy of key table
      Confirm 'all' harvest mode state. Seems it should be "'Dead' or
	'Unknown'" OR "a combination of modes 'destroyed' and 'unknown'".
      Provide an example yaml file in a model-config or model-defaults context
      Re yaml files, which takes precedence? CLI-specified or file?

# Configuring models

A model influences all the machines that Juju creates within it and, in turn,
the applications that get deployed onto those machines. It is therefore a very
powerful feature to be able to configure at the model level.
Model configuration consists of a collection of keys and their respective
values. An explanation of how to both view and set these key:value pairs is
provided below. Notable examples are provided at the end.

## Getting and setting values

You can display the current model settings by running the command:

```bash
juju model-config
```

This will include all the currently set key values - whether they were set by
you, inherited as a default value or dynamically set by Juju. 

A key's value may be set for the current model using the same command:

```bash
juju model-config no-proxy=jujucharms.com
```

It is also possible to specify a list of key-value pairs:
  
```bash
juju model-config test-mode=true enable-os-upgrade=false
```

!!! Note: 
    Juju does not currently check that the provided key is a valid setting, so
    make sure you spell it correctly.

To set a null value:
  
```bash
juju model-config apt-mirror=""
```

To return a value to the default setting the `--reset` flag is used, along
with the key name:
  
```bash
juju model-config --reset test-mode
```

After deployment, the `model-defaults` command allows a user to display the
configuration values for a model as well as set default values that all **new**
models will use. These values can even be specified for each cloud region
instead of just the controller.

To set a default value for 'ftp-proxy', for instance, you would enter the
following:

```bash
juju model-defaults ftp-proxy=10.0.0.1:8000
```

To see both the default values and what they've been changed to, you
would use:

```bash
juju model-defaults
```

To set default values for all new models in a specific controller region, state
the region in the command, shown here using the same example settings as our
previous `model-config` key-value pairs example above:

```bash
juju model-defaults us-east-1 test-mode=true enable-os-upgrade=false
```

Model settings can also be made when creating a new controller via either the
`--config` or `--model-default` options. The difference being that `--config`
affects just the 'controller' and 'default' models while `--model-default`
affects **all** models, including any future ones. Below we use the `--config`
option:

```bash
juju bootstrap --config image-stream=daily localhost lxd-daily
```

See [Creating a controller][controllers-creating] for in-depth coverage on how
to create a controller.

Note that these defaults can be overridden, on a per-model basis, during the
invocation of the `add-model` command (option `--config`) as well as by
resetting specific options to their original defaults through the use of the
`model-config` command (option `--reset`).

Both the `model-config` and `model-defaults` commands can read key value pairs
from a YAML-formatted file. For example:

```bash
juju model-config no-proxy=jujucharms.com more-config-values.yaml
```

### APT mirror

The APT packaging system is used to install and upgrade software on machines
provisioned in the model, and many charms also use APT to install software for
the applications they deploy. It is possible to set a specific mirror for the
APT packages to use, by setting 'apt-mirror':

```bash
juju model-config apt-mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

To restore the default behaviour you would run:

```bash
juju model-config --reset apt-mirror
```

The `apt-mirror` option is often used to point to a local mirror. The
[Working offline][charms-offline] page covers mirrors, proxies, and other
aspects related to network-restricted environments.

### APT updates and upgrades with faster machine provisioning

When Juju provisions a machine, its default behaviour is to upgrade existing
packages to their latest version. If your OS images are fresh and/or your
deployed applications do not require the latest package versions, you can
disable upgrades in order to provision machines faster.

Two Boolean configuration options are available to disable APT updates and
upgrades: `enable-os-refresh-update` (apt-get update) and `enable-os-upgrade`
(apt-get upgrade), respectively.

```yaml
enable-os-refresh-update: false
enable-os-upgrade: false
```

You may also want to just update the package list to ensure a charm has the
latest software available to it by disabling upgrades but enabling updates.

### Disable network management

This can only be used with MAAS models and should otherwise be set to
'false' (default) unless you want to take over network control from Juju
because you have unique and well-defined needs. Setting this to 'true' with
MAAS gives you the same behaviour with containers as you already have with
other providers: one machine-local address on a single network interface,
bridged to the default bridge.

### Firewall mode

Modes available include:

- **instance:** Requests the use of an individual firewall per instance.
- **global:** Uses a single firewall for all instances (access for a network
  port is enabled to one instance if any instance requires that port).
- **none:** Requests that no firewalling should be performed inside the model,
  which is useful for clouds without support for either global or per instance
  security groups.

### Juju lifecycle and harvesting

Juju keeps state on the running model and it can harvest (remove) machines
which it deems are no longer required. This can help reduce running costs and
keep the model tidy. Harvesting is guided by what "harvesting mode" has been
set. 

A Juju machine can be in one of four states:

- **Alive:** The machine is running and being used.
- **Dying:** The machine is in the process of being terminated by Juju, but 
  hasn't yet finished.
- **Dead:** The machine has been successfully brought down by Juju, but is still
  being tracked for removal.
- **Unknown:** The machine exists, but Juju knows nothing about it.

Juju can be in one of several harvesting modes, in order of most conservative
to most aggressive:

- **none:** Machines will never be harvested. This is a good choice if machines
  are managed via a process outside of Juju.
- **destroyed:** Machines will be harvested if i) Juju "knows" about them and
  ii) they are 'Dead'.
- **unknown:** Machines will be harvested if Juju does not "know" about them
  ('Unknown' state). Use with caution in a mixed environment or one which may
  contain multiple instances of Juju.
- **all:** Machines will be harvested if Juju considers them to be 'destroyed'
  or 'unknown'.

The default mode is **destroyed**.

Below, the harvest mode key for the current model is set to 'none':

```bash
juju model-config provisioner-harvest-mode=none
```

### Retrying failed hooks

Juju retries failed hooks automatically using an exponential backoff algorithm.
They will be retried after 5, 10, 20, 40 seconds up to a period of 5 minutes,
and then every 5 minutes. The logic behind this is that some hook errors are
caused by timing issues or the temporary unavailability of other applications -
automatic retry enables the Juju model to heal itself without troubling the
user.

However, in some circumstances, such as debugging charms, this behaviour can be
distracting and unwelcome. For this reason, it is possible to set the
`automatically-retry-hooks` option to 'false' to disable this behaviour. In
this case, users will have to manually retry any hook which fails, using the
command above, as with earlier versions of Juju.

!!! Note:
    Even with the automatic retry enabled, it is still possible to use the
    `juju resolved unit-name/#` command to retry manually.

### Image streams

Juju, by default, uses the slow-changing 'released' images when provisioning
machines. However, the `image-stream` option can be set to 'daily' to use more
up-to-date images, thus shortening the time it takes to perform APT package
upgrades.

### Agent versions and streams

A full definition of an agent is provided on the
[Concepts and terms][concepts-and-terms-agent] page.

The `agent-stream` option specifies the "stream" to use when a Juju agent is to
be installed or upgraded. This setting reflects the general stability of the
software and defaults to 'released', indicating that only the latest stable
version is to be used.

To run the upcoming stable release (before it has passed the normal QA process)
you can set:

```yaml
agent-stream: proposed
```

For testing purposes, you can use the latest unstable version by setting:

```yaml
agent-stream: devel
```

The `agent-version` option specifies a "patch version" for the agent that is to
be installed on a new controller relative to the Juju client's current
major.minor version (Juju uses a major.minor.patch numbering scheme).

For example, Juju 2.3.2 means major version 2, minor version 3, and patch
version 2. On a client system with this release of Juju installed, the machine
agent's version for a newly-created controller would be the same. To specify a
patch version of 1 (instead of 2), the following would be run:

```bash
juju bootstrap aws --agent-version='2.3.1'
```

If a patch version is available that is greater than that of the client then it
can be targeted in this way:

```bash
juju bootstrap aws --auto-upgrade
```

### Container inheritance

The `container-inherit-properties` key allows a limited set of cloudinit
parameters enabled on a Juju machine to be inherited by any hosted containers.
The machine and container must be running the same series.

The parameters are:

 - apt-primary
 - apt-security
 - apt-sources
 - ca-certs

!!! Note:
    The 'apt-security' parameter is not available for the 'trusty' series.

For instance:

```
juju model-config container-inherit-properties="ca-certs, apt-primary"
```
