      Possible to get a list of zones for each region? How can one specify a zone otherwise?

# Using Microsoft Azure with Juju

Juju already has knowledge of the Azure cloud, which means adding your Azure
account to Juju is quick and easy.

You can see more specific information on Juju's Azure support (e.g. the
supported regions) by running:

```bash
juju show-cloud azure
```

If at any point you believe Juju's information is out of date (e.g. Azure just 
announced support for a new region), you can update Juju's public cloud data by
running:
  
```bash
juju update-clouds
```

## Adding credentials

The [Credentials][credentials] page offers a full treatment of credential
management.

Several steps are required to add Azure credentials to Juju:

 - Install the CLI tool
 - Log in to Azure
 - Import the credentials

!!! Note:
    Credentials on the Azure cloud have been reported to expire. If a
    previously working setup suddenly behaves as if incorrect credentials are
    being used then you may need to update the credentials on the controller.
    See [Updating remote credentials][updating-remote-credentials] for
    guidance.

Alternately, you can use your credentials with [Juju as a Service][jaas], where
charms can be deployed within a graphical environment that comes equipped with
a ready-made controller.

### Installing the CLI tool

You will need to import your Azure credentials into Juju using the
[Azure CLI 2.0][azurecli] tool from Microsoft.

Ubuntu/Linux users can install Azure CLI 2.0 with the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash
```

!!! Note:
    For instructions that cover installing Azure CLI on Microsoft Windows and
    Apple macOS, see Microsoft's [Install Azure CLI 2.0][azuretwoinstall]
    documentation.

If the installer encounters any difficulties it will let you know. Examples
include the inability to find your system's Python interpreter or missing
software dependencies. Run any commands that the installer suggests in order to
rectify these deficiencies. You may need to prepend `sudo` to some commands
(only do this if needed). After each command, rerun the above `curl` command.
Accept the suggested default answers to any questions it may ask (by just
pressing 'Enter'). At the end you will be asked to run `exec -l $SHELL` to
restart your shell.

Verify that the tool is properly installed by running `az --version`.

### Logging in to Azure

Log in to your Azure account in order to display the credentials that you will,
in turn, provide to Juju:

```bash
az login
```

This will output a URL and a code, for example:

```no-highlight
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code D6FRLOY6U to authenticate.
```

After entering the code the web site should show 'Microsoft Azure
Cross-platform Command Line Interface'. Press the 'Continue' button.

The resulting page will ask you to "Pick an account". This is just the email
address that you've associated with your Azure account. Click on it.

You are now logged in to your Azure account.

### Importing the credentials

Back on the command line, the output from `az login` should now display your
Azure account information: 

```yaml
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "f717c8c1-8e5e-4d38-be7f-ed1e1c879e18",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "Pay-As-You-Go",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "0fb95fd9-f42f-4c78-94c9-e3d01c2bc5af",
    "user": {
      "name": "javierlarin72@gmail.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

Now initiate the process to import your Azure credentials into Juju:

```bash
juju add-credential azure
```

You will first be asked for an arbitrary credential name (e.g. 'ubuntu').
Secondly, you will be asked to select an 'Auth Type' from among the following
two methods:

- interactive
- service-principal-secret

The default choice is `interactive` and it is the recommended method. It is far
quicker and easier than the manual `service-principal-secret` method. Here,
we'll assume that 'interactive' has been chosen.

!!! Note:
    For guidance on the manual method, see
    [Manually adding Azure credentials][manually-adding-azure-credentials]. Use
    this method if the interactive option fails, or if you want to automate the
    configuration process.

You then will be asked for your subscription id. In the example above, it is
'f717c8c1-8e5e-4d38-be7f-ed1e1c879e18'. The recommended way is to simply press
'Enter' and let the tool automatically retrieve what's needed. If you do so,
after a few seconds you will see the following (assuming 'ubuntu' is the
credential name):

```no-highlight
Credential "ubuntu" added locally for cloud "azure".
```

You can also verify that the credentials were successfully added by running
`juju credentials`.

## Creating a controller

You are now ready to create a Juju controller for cloud 'azure':

```bash
juju bootstrap azure azure-controller
```

Above, the name given to the new controller is 'azure-controller'. Azure will
provision an instance to run the controller on.

This will result in the controller environment being visible in the
[Azure portal][azureportal].

![Juju environment in Azure portal](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/95d6cd3e-azure_portal-environment.png)

For a detailed explanation and examples of the `bootstrap` command see the
[Creating a controller][controllers-creating] page.

## Azure specific features

Juju supports Azure availability sets. See the
[Application high availability][azure-availability-sets] page for more
details.

!!! Note:
    Azure accounts are initially limited to 10 cores (trial accounts can be
    even lower). You will need to file a support ticket with Azure to raise
    your quota limit.

## Next steps

A controller is created with two models - the 'controller' model, which
should be reserved for Juju's internal operations, and a model named
'default', which can be used for deploying user workloads.
