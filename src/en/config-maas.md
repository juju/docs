Title: Configuring for MAAS (bare metal)  


# Configuring for MAAS (bare metal)

Metal As A Service is software which allows you to deal with physical hardware
just as easily as virtual nodes. MAAS lets you treat physical servers like
virtual machines in the cloud. Rather than having to manage each server
individually, MAAS turns your bare metal into an elastic cloud-like resource.
Specifically, MAAS allows for services to be deployed to bare metal via Juju.
For more information about MAAS, see [maas.ubuntu.com](http://maas.ubuntu.com).

To enable Juju to work with MAAS, you should start by generating a generic
configuration file using the command:

```bash
juju generate-config
```

This will generate a file, `environments.yaml`, which, for Linux, will live in
your `~/.juju/` directory (and will create the directory if it doesn't already
exist).

!!! Note: If you have an existing configuration, you can use
`juju generate-config --show` to output the new config file, then copy and
paste relevant areas in a text editor etc.


## Get your API key

You'll need an API key from MAAS so that the Juju client can access it. Each
user account in MAAS can have as many API keys as desired. One hard and fast
rule is that you'll need to use a different API key for each Juju environment
you set up within a single MAAS cluster.

To get the API key:

1. Go to your MAAS preferences page, or go to your MAAS home page and choose
   Preferences from the drop-down menu that appears when clicking your username
   at the top-right of the page.
1. Optionally add a new MAAS key. Do this if you're setting up another
   environment within the same MAAS cluster.
1. Copy the key value - you will need it shortly!


##  Edit or create the configuration

Create or modify `environments.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
maas:
    type: maas
    maas-server: 'http://<my-maas-server>:80/MAAS'
    maas-oauth: 'MAAS-API-KEY'
```

Substitute the API key from earlier into the `MAAS_API_KEY` slot. You may need
to modify the `my-maas-server` setting too; if you're running from the maas
package it should be something like "http://hostname.xxxx.yyy/MAAS".

It is also useful to add your SSH keys to the configuration, as MAAS will then
be able to automatically add them to each unit. This may be done simply by 
adding the following option to the config:

```yaml
authorized-keys-path: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
```

...or point to any other appropriate key file.

An admin password will be generated when you try and bootstrap the Juju
instance. This can optionally be specified in the configuration:

```yaml
 admin-secret: asecurepassword
```

The default series for MAAS will automatically be set to 'precise'. You can override 
this setting by adding the optional configuration:

```yaml
 default-series: trusty
```


## MAAS specific features

Juju automatically detects MAAS networks, and recognises physical and
virtual networks on each machine. `juju status` will show the discovered
networks. See [Juju Constraints](./reference-constraints.html) and [Deploying
Services](./charms-deploying.html) to learn how to select machines with networks
and enable the networks for use.

Juju recognises MAAS-controlled hostnames. You can use the hostname when
bootstrapping the state-server on a specific machine and add existing
MAAS-controlled machines to the Juju environment. For example:

```bash
juju bootstrap --to <hostname>
juju add-machine <hostname>
```
### MAAS devices

MAAS 1.8 introduced a new feature called "devices". This allows the
association of a "device", that requires an IP address, with a parent machine
managed by MAAS. There is a view in the MAAS UI showing all devices.

With the "address-allocation" feature flag enabled, Juju will register LXC and
KVM containers as devices on MAAS 1.8+. They are visible in the MAAS UI. If
the environment is forcibly shut down, the IP addresses allocated to the
containers will be released by MAAS.

You can enable "address-allocation" in new Juju environments like so:

    JUJU_DEV_FEATURE_FLAGS=address-allocation




For further information on using Juju with MAAS, see the
[MAAS and Juju Quick Start guide](http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/juju-quick-start.html).


## Additional notes

See [General config options](config-general.html) for additional and advanced
customization of your environment.
