# Configuring controllers

A Juju controller is the management node of a Juju cloud environment. It houses
the database and keeps track of all the models in that environment.

Controller configuration consists of a collection of keys and their respective
values. An explanation of how to both view and set these key:value pairs is
provided below.

## Getting values

A controller's configuration key values can be listed by running this command:

```bash
juju controller-config
```

The key-value pairs that are shown will include those that were set during
controller creation (see below), inherited as a default value (see table), or
dynamically set by Juju. 

## Setting values

To set a key's value use the `--config` option during the controller creation
process (see [Creating a controller][controllers-creating]). For example, to
create and configure a cloud named 'lxd':

```bash
juju bootstrap --config bootstrap-timeout=700 lxd
```

In general, once a controller is created, all its settings become immutable.
Exceptions to this rule are three of the keys related to audit logging:

 - auditing-enabled
 - audit-log-capture-args
 - audit-log-exclude-methods
 
!!! Note:
    The `--config` option may also be used to configure the 'default' model.
    In addition, the `model-default` option can usually always be used in place
    of the `--config` option. See [Configuring models][models-config] for more
    information on how models get configured and how these two options differ.

## List of controller keys

This table lists all the controller keys which may be assigned a value.

| Key                        | Type    | Default  | Valid values             | Purpose |
|:---------------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------|:---------|
api-port                     | integer | 17070    |                          | The port to use for connecting to the API
auditing-enabled             | bool    | false    | false/true               | Sets whether audit logging is enabled. Can be toggled for an existing controller.
audit-log-capture-args       | bool    | false    | false/true               | Sets whether the audit log will contain the arguments passed to API methods. Can be toggled for an existing controller.  
audit-log-exclude-methods    | string  | ReadOnlyMethods | [Some.Method,...] | What information to exclude from the audit log. Can be set for an existing controller. See [additional info][anchor__excluding-information-from-the-audit-log].
audit-log-max-backups        | integer | 10       |                          | The maximum number of backup audit log files to keep.

By default, certificates are obtained from LetsEncrypt. A good value for testing is "https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory".
allow-model-access           | bool   |          | false/true               | Sets whether the controller will allow users to connect to models they have been authorized for even when they don't have any access rights to the controller itself.
bootstrap-timeout            | integer | 600     |                          | How long in seconds to wait for a connection to the controller
bootstrap-retry-delay        | integer | 5       |                          | How long in seconds to wait between connection attempts to a controller
bootstrap-address-delay      | integer | 10      |                          | How often in seconds to refresh controller addresses from the API server
ca-cert                      | string |          |                          | The certificate of the CA that signed the controller's CA certificate, in PEM format
controller-uuid              | string |          |                          | The key for the UUID of the controller
identity-public-key          | string |          |                          | Sets the public key of the identity manager. Feature not yet implemented.
identity-url                 | string |          |                          | Sets the URL of the identity manager. Feature not yet implemented.
max-logs-age                 | string | 72h      | 72h, etc.                | Sets the maximum age for log entries before they are pruned, in human-readable time format
max-logs-size                | string | 4G       | 400M, 5G, etc.           | Sets the maximum size for the log collection, in human-readable memory format
max-txn-log-size             | string | 10M      | 100M, 1G, etc.           | Sets the maximum size for the capped txn log collection, in human-readable memory format
mongo-memory-profile         | string | low      | low/default              | Sets whether MongoDB uses the least possible memory or the default MongoDB memory profile
set-numa-control-policy      | bool   | false    | false/true               | Sets whether numactl is preferred for running processes with a specific NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) scheduling or memory placement policy for multiprocessor systems where memory is divided into multiple memory nodes
state-port                   | integer | 37017   |                          | The port to use for mongo connections

### Excluding information from the audit log

See [Audit logging][troubleshooting-logs-audit] for background information on
this topic.

Excluding information from the audit log is done via the
`audit-log-exclude-methods` key above, which refers to API calls/methods. The
recommended approach for configuring the filter is to view the log and make a
list of those calls deemed undesirable. There is no definitive API call list
available in this documentation.

The default value of key `audit-log-exclude-methods` is the special value of
'ReadOnlyMethods'. As the name suggests, this represents all read-only events.

An example value for this key is: `[Pinger.Ping]` where a log message intended
for removal (by including 'Pinger.Ping' as a value) contains the following
text:

```no-highlight
"request-id":4428,"when":"2018-02-12T20:03:45Z","facade":"Pinger","method":"Ping","version":1}}
```

!!! Important:
    Only those Conversations whose methods have *all* been excluded will be
    omitted. For instance, assuming a default filter of 'ReadOnlyMethods', if a
    Conversation contains several read-only events and a single write event
    then all these events will appear in the log.

key value of 'ReadOnlyMethods'.
