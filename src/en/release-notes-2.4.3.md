Title: 2.4.3 Release Notes 

# 2.4.3 Release Notes

The Juju team is pleased to announce the release of Juju 2.4.3.

This is a bug fix release. In particular, it fixes a backwards incompatible
change to `juju config` output and an intermittent agent shutdown hang.

For the full list of fixes and additions, see the
[2.4.3 milestone](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.4.3).

## Get Juju

The easiest way to install Juju is by using the `snap` package:

	  sudo snap install juju --classic

Those already using the 'stable' snap channel (the default as per the above
command) should be upgraded automatically. Other packages are available for a
variety of platforms (see the [install documentation][reference-install]).
