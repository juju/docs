Title: Getting things done

# Getting things done

Juju is not all about marvelling about how great service orchestration is, it's
actually about getting things done. While the documentation provides you with
instructions on how Juju works, this section is all about putting those commands
together to do something useful. Prepare to get things done!

- [Configure metrics gathering with Prometheus](./howto-prometheus.html)
- [Set up a private cloud with Simplestreams](./howto-privatecloud.html)
- [Change a machine's series (prior to 2.3)](./howto-machineupdateseries.html)
