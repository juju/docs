Title: Credentials
TODO:  Investigate: shouldn't `model-config` have a default-credential setting?
       Add to mycreds.yaml: cloudsigma, rackspace, and oracle. also openstack using access-key
       Investigate: can private keys always be replaced by a file path?

# Credentials

In order to access your cloud, Juju needs to know how to authenticate itself.
We use the term *credential* to collectively describe the material necessary to
do this (e.g. username & password, or just a secret key). During the addition
of a credential the user assigns to it an arbitrary name.

When credentials are added for a given cloud they become available for use on
that cloud's controller and models. There are therefore two categories of
credentials: those that are available to the Juju client (local) and those that
are active and have been uploaded to a controller (remote).

A credential becomes active when it is related to a model for the first time.
The two commands that can do this are `bootstrap` and `add-model` as both
commands involve the creation of at least one model.

An active credential is always associated with one cloud, one Juju user, and
one, or more, models. A model, however, is always related to a single
credential.
 
## Adding credentials

Juju supports three methods for adding credentials:

 - accepting credentials provided interactively by the user on the command line
 - scanning for existing credentials via environment variables and/or "rc"
   files (only supported by certain providers)
 - reading a user-provided [YAML-formatted][yaml] file
  
!!! Note:
    A local LXD cloud is a special case. When accessed from a Juju admin user,
    a credential does not need to be added; a 10-yr certificate is set up
    for you. However, when accessed from a non-admin user this is not the case.
    See [Additional LXD resources][clouds-lxd-resources-non-admin-creds] for
    details. 

Added credentials get saved to file `~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml`.

### Adding credentials interactively

To add credentials interactively use the `add-credential` command. To do so
with the AWS cloud:

```bash
juju add-credential aws
```

You will be asked for information based on the chosen cloud. For the AWS cloud
the resulting interactive session looks like:

```no-highlight
Enter credential name: carol

Using auth-type "access-key".

Enter access-key: AKBAICUYUPFXID2GHC5S

Enter secret-key: *********************** (does not echo back)

Credential "carol" added locally for cloud "aws".
```

If you end up adding multiple credentials for the same cloud you will need to
set one as the default. See below section
[Setting default credentials][#setting-default-credentials].

### Adding credentials from environment variables

Certain cloud providers offer command line tools that rely on environment
variables to store credentials. Juju supports the scanning of such variables as
a way to add them to itself. Scanning is done with the `autoload-credentials`
command:

```bash
juju autoload-credentials
```

Any variables detected will cause a prompt to appear. You will be asked to
confirm the addition of their respective values as well as to provide a name to
call the credential set.

!!! Note:
    You will need to rescan the variables if their values ever change. A scan
    only picks up *current* values.

There are three providers that use tools that support this method:
[Amazon AWS][clouds-aws-using-env-variables],
[Google GCE][clouds-google-using-env-variables], and
[OpenStack][clouds-openstack-using-env-variables].

The `autoload-credentials` command is also used to generate a certificate
credential for localhost clouds. This is needed for providing access to
non-admin Juju users. See
[Additional LXD resources][clouds-lxd-resources-non-admin-creds].
    
### Adding credentials from a file

You can use a YAML-formatted file to store credentials for any cloud. Below we
provide a sample file, which we will call `mycreds.yaml`. It includes many of
the clouds supported by Juju and uses the most common options. Note the MAAS
cloud and the two OpenStack clouds, called 'homemaas', 'myopenstack' and
'homestack' respectively.

Credentials are added to Juju on a per-cloud basis. To add credentials for the
defined 'azure' cloud, for instance, we would do this:

```bash
juju add-credential azure -f mycreds.yaml
```

!!! Note:
    All available authentication types are outlined in section
    [Adding clouds manually][clouds-adding-clouds-manually] on the Clouds page.
    
## Managing credentials

The following credential management tasks are covered:

 - [Setting default credentials][#setting-default-credentials]
 - [Listing local credentials][#listing-local-credentials]
 - [Listing remote credentials][#listing-remote-credentials]
 - [Updating local credentials][#updating-local-credentials]
 - [Updating remote credentials][#updating-remote-credentials]
 - [Removing local credentials][#removing-local-credentials]
 - [Changing a remote credential for a model][#changing-a-remote-credential-for-a-model]

### Setting default credentials

To set the default credential for a cloud:

```bash
juju set-default-credential aws carol
```

If only one credential exists for a cloud, it becomes the effective default
credential for that cloud.

Setting a default affects operations that require a new credential to be used
by Juju. These are the creation of a controller (`bootstrap`) and the addition
of a model (`add-model`). It does not change what is currently in use (on a
controller). 

A default must be defined if multiple credentials exist for a given cloud. With
both the above commands a credential can be specified with the `--credential`
option. Failure to do so will cause an error to be emitted:

```no-highlight
ERROR more than one credential is available
specify a credential using the --credential argument
```

### Listing local credentials

You can display what credentials are available by running the
`credentials` command:

```bash
juju credentials
```

Sample output:

<!-- JUJUVERSION: 2.0.0-genericlinux-amd64 -->
<!-- JUJUCOMMAND: juju credentials -->
```no-highlight
Cloud   Credentials
aws     bob*, carol
google  wayne
```

An asterisk denotes a default credential. In the above output, credential 'bob'
is the default for cloud 'aws' and no default has been specified for cloud
'google'. Default credentials are covered in more depth later on.

To reveal actual authentication material (e.g. passwords, keys):

```bash
juju credentials --format yaml --show-secrets
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
local-credentials:
  aws:
    bob:
      auth-type: access-key
      access-key: AKIAXZUYGB6UED2GNC5A
      secret-key: StB2bmL1+tX+VX7neVgy/3JosJAwOcBIO53nyCVp
```

Notice how the output says 'local-credentials', meaning they are stored on
the local Juju client.

### Listing remote credentials

To see what credential is in use by a model (here the 'default' model) the
`show-model` command can be used:

```bash
juju show-model default
```

Partial output:

```no-highlight
default:
  name: admin/default
  ...
  ...
  credential:
    name: bob
    owner: admin
    cloud: aws
```

The `models --format yaml` command also shows this information, albeit for all
models.

The above commands do not display authentication material. Use the
`show-credentials` command to view the active credentials, including the cloud
name, credential names, and model names:

```bash
juju show-credentials --show-secrets
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
controller-credentials:
  aws:
    bob:
      content:
        auth-type: access-key
        access-key: AKIAXZUYGB6UED2GNC5A
        secret-key: StB2bmL1+tX+VX7neVgy/3JosJAwOcBIO53nyCVp
      models:
        controller: admin
        default: admin
```

Notice how the output says 'controller-credentials', meaning they are stored on
the controller.

The `show-credentials` command queries the controller to get its information.

### Updating local credentials

To update an existing credential locally use the `add-credential` command with
the `--replace` option.

Here we decided to use the file 'mycreds.yaml' from a previous example:

```bash
juju add-credential --replace aws -f mycreds.yaml
```

Any existing credential will be overwritten by an identically named credential
in the file. As a safeguard to inadvertently overwriting credentials, an error
will be emitted if the `--replace` option is not used:

```no-highlight
ERROR local credentials for cloud "aws" already exist; use --replace to overwrite / merge
```

Updating credentials in this way does not update credentials currently in use
(on an existing controller/cloud). See the next section for that.

### Updating remote credentials

To update credentials currently in use (i.e. stored on a controller) the
`update-credential` command is used. It does this by uploading an identically
named local credential.

Before an update occurs, Juju ensures that the new credential contents can
authenticate with the backing cloud and that any machines that may reside
within a model currently related to the credential remain accessible. 

The requirements for using this command, as compared to the initial `bootstrap`
(or `juju add-model`) command, are:

 - same cloud name
 - same Juju username (logged in)
 - same credential name

The update is a two-step process. First change the credentials locally as shown
previously and then upload those credentials to the controller.

Below, we explicitly log in with the correct Juju username ('admin'), change
the contents of the credential called 'joe' (included in file `mycreds.yaml`),
and then update that credential for cloud 'google':

```bash
juju login -u admin
juju add-credential --replace google -f mycreds.yaml
juju update-credential google joe
```

The `update-credential` command is the only command that can alter a credential
cached on a controller.

#### Updating remote credentials using a different Juju user

If you are unable to ascertain the original Juju username then you will need
to use a different one. This implies adding a new credential name, copying over
any authentication material into the old credential name, and finally updating
the credentials. Below we demonstrate this for the Azure cloud:

Add a new temporary credential name (like 'new-credential-name') and gather all
credential sets (new and old):

```bash
juju add-credential azure
juju credentials azure --format yaml --show-secrets > azure-creds.yaml
```

Copy the values of `application-id` and `application-password` from the new set
to the old set.

Then replace the local credentials and upload them to the controller:

```bash
juju add-credential azure -f azure-creds.yaml --replace
juju update-credential azure old-credential-name
```

To be clear, the file `azure-creds.yaml` (used with `add-credential`) should
look similar to:

```no-highlight
Credentials:
  azure:
    new-credential-name:
      auth-type: service-principal-secret
      application-id: foo1
      application-password: foo2
      subscription-id: bar
    old-credential-name:
      auth-type: service-principal-secret
      application-id: foo1
      application-password: foo2
      subscription-id: bar
```

### Removing local credentials

The `remove-credential` command is used to remove a local credential (i.e. not
cached on a controller):

```bash
juju remove-credential aws bob
```

### Changing a remote credential for a model

To change what remote credential is used for a model the `set-credential`
command (`v.2.5.0`) is available to the controller admin or the model owner.
For instance, to have remote credential 'bob' be used for model 'trinity' (for
cloud 'aws'):

```bash
juju set-credential -m trinity aws bob
```

This command does not affect how the credential may relate to another model. If
the credential is already related to a single model this operation will result
in that credential being related to two models.

!!! Note:
    If the stated credential does not exist remotely but it does locally then
    the local credential will be uploaded to the controller. The command will
    error out if the credential is neither remote nor local.
