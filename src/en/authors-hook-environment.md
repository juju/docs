Title: The hook environment, hook tools and how hooks are run  

# How hooks are run

When a charm is deployed onto a unit, the raw charm is extracted into a
directory; this directory is known as the charm directory. It's owned and
operated by Juju, and Juju sometimes temporarily cedes control of it to user
code, by running a hook inside it.

When a hook's running, it should be considered to have sole access to the charm
directory; at all other times, you should consider that Juju may be making
arbitrarily scary changes to the directory, and that it is not safe to read or
write to anything in there at all.

This is to say that the software you install must, once it's running, be
entirely independent of the charm that created it. It's fine (and encouraged,
with some caveats) to store _charm_ state in the charm directory, but the state
of your _software_ must remain unperturbed by direct changes to the charm.

So, every hook runs with easy access to the charm files. Every hook also runs as
root, with a number of useful variables set, and has access to hook-specific
tools that let you interrogate and affect the Juju environment.

No more than one hook will execute on a given system at a given time. A unit in
a container is considered to be on a different system to any unit on the
container's host machine.

## Environment variables

The following variables are always available.

  - The `$CHARM_DIR` variable is the path to the charm directory.
  - The `$PATH` variable is prefixed with the path to the hook tools directory.
  - The `$JUJU_UNIT_NAME` variable holds the name of the unit.
  - The `$JUJU_API_ADDRESSES` variable holds a space-separated list of API 
    server addresses.
  - The `$JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE` variable holds the current availability zone
    the charm is running in (not all cloud providers support Availability 
    Zones).
   
In addition, every relation hook makes available relation-specific variables:

  - The `$JUJU_RELATION` variable holds the relation name. This information
  is of limited value, because it's always the same as the part of the hook
  name just before "-relation-".
  - The `$JUJU_RELATION_ID` variable holds an opaque relation identifier, used
  to distinguish between multiple relations with the same name. It is vitally
  important, because it's the only reasonable way of telling the difference
  between (say) a database service's many independent clients.

...and, if that relation hook is not a 
[-broken](authors-charm-hooks.html#[name]-relation-broken) hook:

  - The `$JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT` variable holds the name of the unit which is
  being reported to have -joined, -changed, or -departed.

Juju does _not_ pay any attention to the values of the above variables when
running hook tools: they're a one-way communication channel from Juju to the
charm only. Finally, in all cases:

  - The `$JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET` and `$JUJU_CONTEXT_ID` variables allow the hook
    tools to work: Juju _does_ pay attention to them, but you should treat
    them as opaque and avoid messing with them.

Finally, if you're [debugging](./authors-hook-debug.html), you'll also have
access to:

  - The `$JUJU_HOOK_NAME` variable, which will be set to the current hook name.

## Hook tools

All hook tools are available in all hooks. Many of the tools produce output,
and those that do accept a `--format` flag whose value can be set to `json` or
`yaml` as desired. If it's not specified, the format defaults to `smart`, which
transforms the basic output as follows:

  - strings are left untouched
  - boolean values are converted to the strings `True` and `False`
  - ints and floats are converted directly to strings
  - lists of strings are converted to a single newline-separated string
  - all other types (in general, dictionaries) are formatted as YAML

Tools which do not produce output also accept the `--format` flag, but ignore
it, for compatibility reasons.

The various "relation-" tools infer context from the hook where possible. If
they're running in a relation hook, the current relation identifier is set as 
the default; and if they're running in a -joined, -changed, or -broken hook, 
the current remote unit is set as the default.

To use relation hooks effectively, you should spend time making sure you 
understand the [relation model](./authors-relations-in-depth.html).

### juju-log

`juju-log` writes its arguments directly to the unit's log file. All hook
output is currently logged anyway, though this may not always be the case - If 
it's important, please `juju-log` it.

```bash
juju-log "some important text"
```

This tool accepts a `--debug` flag which causes the message to be logged at
`DEBUG` level; in all other cases it's logged at `INFO` level.

### juju-reboot [--now]

There are several cases where a charm needs to reboot a machine, such as 
after a kernel upgrade, or to upgrade the entire system. The charm may not
be able to complete the hook until the machine is rebooted.

The `juju-reboot` command allows charm authors to schedule a reboot from inside
a charm hook. The reboot will only happen if the hook completes without error. 
You can schedule a reboot like so:

```bash
juju-reboot
```

The `--now` option can be passed to block hook execution. in this case the
`juju-reboot` command will hang until the unit agent stops the hook and 
re-queues it for the next run. This will allow you to create multi-step 
install hooks.

Charm authors must wrap calls to `juju-reboot` to ensure it is actually 
necessary, otherwise the charm risks entering a reboot loop. The preferred
work-flow is to check if the feature/charm is in the desired state, and
reboot when needed. This bash example assumes that "$FEATURE_IS_INSTALLED"
variable was defined by a check for the feature, then 'juju-reboot' is
called if the variable is false:

```bash
if [[ $FEATURE_IS_INSTALLED  == "false" ]]
then
    install_feature
    juju-reboot --now
fi
```

The `juju-reboot` command can be called from any hook. It can also be 
called using the `juju run` command.

### unit-get

`unit-get` returns information about the local unit. It accepts a single
argument, which must be `private-address` or `public-address`. It is not
affected by context:

```no-highlight
unit-get private-address
10.0.1.101
unit-get public-address
foo.example.com
```

### config-get

`config-get` returns information about the service configuration (as defined by
the charm). If called without arguments, it returns a dictionary containing all
config settings that are either explicitly set, or which have a non-nil default
value. If the `--all` flag is passed, it returns a dictionary containing all
defined config settings including nil values (for those without defaults). If
called with a single argument, it returns the value of that config key. Missing
config keys are reported as having a value of nil, and do not return an error.

Getting the interesting bits of the config is done with:

```no-highlight
config-get
key: some-value
another-key: default-value
```

To get the whole config including the nulls:

```no-highlight
config-get --all
key: some-value
another-key: default-value
no-default: null
```

To retrieve a specific value pass its key as argument:

```no-highlight
config-get [key]
some-value
```

This command will also work if no value is set and no default is set or even
if the setting doesn't exist. In both cases nothing will be returned.

```no-highlight
config-get [key-with-no-default]
config-get [missing-key]
```

!!! Note: The above two examples are not misprints - asking for a value which
doesn't exist or has not been set returns nothing and raises no errors.

### open-port

`open-port` marks a port or range of ports on the local system as appropriate to
open, if and when the service is exposed to the outside world. It accepts a
single port or range of ports with an optional protocol, which may be `udp` or
`tcp`, where `tcp` is the default.

Examples:

Open 80/tcp if and when the service is exposed:

```no-highlight
open-port 80
```

Open 1234/udp if and when the service is exposed:

```no-highlight
open-port 1234/udp
```

Open the range 8000 to 8080:

```no-highlight
open 8000-8080/tcp
```

`open-port` will not have any effect if the service is not exposed, and may have
a somewhat delayed effect even if it is. This operation is transactional, so 
changes will certainly not be made unless the hook exits successfully.

Juju also tracks ports opened across the machine and will not allow conflicts - 
if another charm has already opened the port 
(**or one or more ports in a range**) you have specified,
your request will be ignored. 
 
This command accepts and ignores `--format` for
compatibility purposes, but it doesn't produce any output.

### close-port

`close-port` unmarks a local system port. If the service is not exposed, it has
no effect; otherwise the port is marked for imminent closure. It accepts the
same flags and arguments as `open-port`.

Examples:

Close 1234/udp if it was open:

```no-highlight
close-port 1234/udp
```

Close port 80 if it was open:

```no-highlight
close-port 80
```

Close a range of ports:

```no-highlight
close-port 80-100
```

### opened-ports

The opened-ports hook tool lists all the ports currently opened 
**by the running charm**. It does not, at the moment, include ports which may
be opened by other charms co-hosted on the same machine
[lp#1427770](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1427770). 

The command returns a list of one port or range of ports per line, with the port
number followed by the protocol (tcp or udp).

For example, running `opened-ports` may return:

```no-highlight
70-80/tcp
81/tcp
```

!!! Note: opening ports is transactional (i.e. will take place on successfully 
exiting the current hook), and therefore `opened-ports` will not return any
values for pending `open-port` operations run from within the same hook. 


### relation-set

`relation-set` writes the local unit's settings for some relation. It accepts
any number of `key=value` strings, and an optional `-r` argument, which 
defaults to the current relation identifier. If it's not running in a relation 
hook, `-r` needs to be specified. The `value` part of an argument is not 
inspected, and is stored directly as a string. Setting an empty string causes 
the setting to be removed.

Examples:

Setting a pair of values for the local unit in the default relation identifier 
which is stored in the environment variable `JUJU_RELATION_ID`:

```bash
echo $JUJU_RELATION_ID
server:3
```

The setting is done with:

```no-highlight
relation-set username=bob password=2db673e81ffa264c
```

To set the pair of values for the local unit in a specific relation specify the
relation identifier:

```no-highlight
relation-set -r server:3 username=jim password=12345
```

To clear a value for the local unit in the default relation enter:

```no-highlight
relation-set deprecated-or-unused=
```

`relation-set` is the single tool at your disposal for communicating your own
configuration to units of related services. At least by convention, the charm
that `provides` an interface is likely to set values, and a charm that
`requires` that interface will read them; but there's nothing forcing this.
Whatever information you need to propagate for the remote charm to work must be
propagated via relation-set, with the single exception of the `private-address`
key, which is always set before the unit joins.

You may wish to overwrite the `private-address` setting, for example if you're
writing a charm that serves as a proxy for some external service; but you 
should in general avoid _removing_ that key, because most charms expect that
value to exist unconditionally.

All values set are stored locally until the hook completes; at that point, if
the hook exit code is 0, all changed values will be communicated to the rest of
the system, causing -changed hooks to run in all related units.

There is no way to write settings for any unit other than the local unit; but
any hook on the local unit can write settings for any relation the local unit
is participating in.

### relation-get

`relation-get` reads the settings of the local unit, or of any remote unit, 
in a given relation (set with `-r`, defaulting to the current relation 
identifier, as in `relation-set`). The first argument specifies the settings 
key, and the second the remote unit, which may be omitted if a default is 
available (that is, when running a relation hook other than -broken).

If the first argument is omitted, a dictionary of all current keys and values
will be printed; all values are always plain strings without any 
interpretation. If you need to specify a remote unit but want to see all 
settings, use `-` for the first argument.

The environment variable `JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT` stores the default remote unit:

```bash
echo $JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT
 mongodb/2
```

Getting the settings of the default unit in the default relation is done with:

```no-highlight
relation-get
 username: jim
 password: "12345"
```

To get a specific setting from the default remote unit in the default relation
you would instead use:

    
```no-highlight
relation-get username
 jim
```

To get all settings from a particular remote unit in a particular relation you
specify them together with the command:

```no-highlight
relation-get -r database:7 - mongodb/5
 username: bob
 password: 2db673e81ffa264c
```

Note that `relation-get` produces results that are _consistent_ but not
necessarily _accurate_, in that you will always see settings that:

  - were accurate at some point in the reasonably recent past
  - are always the same within a single hook run...
  - _except_ when inspecting the unit's own relation settings, in which case
    local changes from `relation-set` will be seen correctly.

You should never depend upon the presence of any given key in `relation-get`
output. Processing that depends on specific values (other than `private-address`) 
should be restricted to [-changed](authors-charm-hooks.html#[name]-relation-changed)
hooks for the relevant unit, and the absence
of a remote unit's value should never be treated as an
[error](./authors-hook-errors.html) in the local unit.

In practice, it is common and encouraged for -relation-changed hooks to exit
early, without error, after inspecting `relation-get` output and determining it
to be inadequate; and for [all other hooks](authors-charm-hooks.html) to be
resilient in the face of missing keys, such that -relation-changed hooks will be
sufficient to complete all configuration that depends on remote unit settings.

Settings for remote units already known to have departed remain accessible for
the lifetime of the relation.

!!! Note: `relation-get` currently has a
[bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1223339)
that allows units of the same service to see each other's
settings outside of a peer relation. Depending on this behaviour inadvisable: if
you need to share settings between units of the same service, always use a peer
relation to do so, or you may be seriously inconvenienced when
the hole is closed without notice.

### relation-list

`relation-list` outputs a list of all the related **units** for a relation 
identifier. If not running in a relation hook context, `-r` needs to be 
specified with a relation identifier similar to the`relation-get` and 
`relation-set` commands. 

Examples:

To show all remote units for the current relation identifier:

```no-highlight
relation-list
```

Which should return something similar to:

```no-highlight
mongodb/0
mongodb/2
mongodb/3
```
All remote units in a specific relation identifier can be shown with:

```no-highlight
relation-list -r website:2
 haproxy/0
```

### relation-ids

`relation-ids` outputs a list of the related **services** with a relation 
name. Accepts a single argument (relation-name) which, in a relation hook, 
defaults to the name of the current relation. The output is useful as input 
to the `relation-list`, `relation-get`, and `relation-set` commands to read 
or write other relation values.

Examples:

The current relation name is stored in the environment variable 
`JUJU_RELATION`. All "server" relation identifiers can be shown with:

```no-highlight
relation-ids
server:1
server:7
server:9
```

To show all relation identifiers with a different name pass it as an argument -
for example:

```no-highlight
relation-ids reverseproxy
    reverseproxy:3
```

Note again that all commands that produce output accept `--format json` and
`--format yaml`, and you may consider it smarter to use those for clarity's 
sake than to depend on the default `smart` format.


### status-set

Introduced in version 1.24 of Juju, a new status mechanism allows Juju and its 
charms to more accurately reflect their current status. This places the 
responsibility on the charm to know its status, and set it accordingly using
the `status-set` hook tool.
This hook tool takes 2 arguments. The first is the status to report, which can 
be one of the following:

  - maintenance (the unit is not currently providing a service, but expects to 
    be soon, E.g. when first installing)
  - blocked (the unit cannot continue without user input)
  - waiting (the unit itself is not in error and requires no intervention, 
    but it is not currently in service as it depends on some external factor, 
    e.g. a service to which it is related is not running)
  - active (This unit believes it is correctly offering all the services it is
    primarily installed to provide)

For more extensive explanations of these statuses, and other possible status
values which may be set by Juju itself,
[please see the status reference page](./reference-status.html).

The second argument is a user-facing message, which will be displayed to any
users viewing the status, and will also be visible in the status history. This
can contain any useful information. 

This status message provides valuable feedback to the user about what is
happening. Changes in the status message are not broadcast to peers and
counterpart units - they are for the benefit of humans only, so tools
representing Juju services (e.g. the Juju GUI) should check occasionally 
and be told the current status message.

Spamming the status with many changes per second would not be welcome
(and might be throttled by the state server). Nevertheless, a thoughtful charm
will provide appropriate and timely feedback for human users, with estimated
times of completion of long-running status changes, for example.

In the case of a `blocked` status though the **status message should tell the
user explicitly how to unblock the unit** insofar as possible, as this is
primary way of indicating any action to be taken (and may be surfaced by other
tools using Juju, e.g. the Juju GUI).

A unit in the `active` state with should not generally expect anyone to look at
its status message, and often it is better not to set one at all. In the event
of a degradation of service, this is a good place to surface an explanation for
the degradation (load, hardware failure or other issue).

A unit in `error` state will have a message that is set by Juju and not the
charm because the error state represents a crash in a charm hook - an unmanaged
and uninterpretable situation. Juju will set the message to be a reflection of
the hook which crashed. For example “Crashed installing the software” for an
install hook crash, or “Crash establishing database link” for a crash in a
relationship hook.

Examples:

```no-highlight
status-set maintenance "installing software"
status-set maintenance "formatting storage space, time left: 120s"
status-set waiting "waiting for database"
status-set active 
status-set active "Storage 95% full"
status-set blocked "Need a database relation"
status-set blocked "Storage full"
```

### status-get

The `status-get` hook tool allows a charm to query what is recorded in Juju as 
the current workload status. Without arguments, it just prints the workload
status value e.g. 'maintenance'. With `--include-data` specified, it prints
YAML which contains the status value plus any data associated with the status.

Examples:

```no-highlight
status-get
status-get --include-data
```
