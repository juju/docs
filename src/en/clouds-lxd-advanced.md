Title: Using LXD with Juju - advanced

# Using LXD with Juju - advanced

This page is dedicated to more advanced topics related to using LXD with Juju.
The main page is [Using LXD with Juju][clouds-lxd].

The topics presented here are:

 - LXD clustering
 - Adding a remote LXD cloud
 - Charms and LXD profiles

## LXD clustering

LXD clustering (lxd `v.3` and greater) allows for distributed computing to the
extent that Juju units end up on different cluster nodes (LXD hosts) by
default. It also offers high availability so that the cluster remains
functional as long as more than half of the nodes are up. A downed node will
lead to its hosted containers becoming unavailable.

In terms of adding a LXD cloud, Juju is indifferent as to whether it is
clustered or not. Juju connects to a single LXD host and, when prompted for
connection information, you will need to decide which host that is. It should
be noted that if this host becomes unavailable Juju will lose connection to the
entire cluster.

!!! Important:
    Each cluster node must have a network bridge that is connected to LXD. This
    is to allow the client to communicate with the Juju machines (containers).

Clustering is configured by running `lxd init` on each LXD host (a minimum of
three is recommended). The first host that does so will *initialise* the
cluster and any subsequent node will *join* the cluster. When joining, `sudo`
is required.

Once the cluster is set up a controller can be created and will end up randomly
on one of the nodes. Since `v.2.5.0`, however, specific cluster nodes can be
targeted. See [Deploying to specific machines][deploying-to-specific-machines]
for how to do this.

!!! Warning:
    The cluster-creation process will remove any existing containers. In a Juju
    context, this implies that you must initialise the cluster *before*
    creating a controller.

See the upstream documentation on [Clustering][lxd-upstream-clustering].

## Adding a remote LXD cloud

The traditional way of using LXD with Juju is by having both the Juju client
and the LXD daemon local to each other. However, since `v.2.5.0` Juju supports
connecting to a remote LXD daemon. Doing so does not require LXD to be
installed alongside the Juju client.

Use the `add-cloud` command in interactive mode to add a LXD cloud to Juju's
list of clouds. You will need to supply the name you wish to call your cloud
and the unique LXD API endpoint.

For the manual method of adding a LXD cloud, see below section
[Manually adding a remote LXD cloud][#clouds-lxd-remote-add-manual].

```bash
juju add-cloud
```

Example user session:

```no-highlight
Cloud Types

  lxd
  maas
  manual
  openstack
  vsphere

Select cloud type: lxd

Enter a name for your lxd cloud: lxd-remote

Enter the API endpoint url for the remote LXD server: https://10.55.60.244:8443                                                                                                   

Auth Types
  certificate

Select one or more auth types separated by commas [certificate]: 

Enter region [default]: 

Enter the API endpoint url for the region [use cloud api url]: 

Enter another region? (y/N): n

Cloud "lxd-remote" successfully added

You may need to `juju add-credential lxd-remote' if your cloud needs additional credentials
Then you can bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap lxd-remote'
```

!!! Important:
    The remote LXD server needs to be available over the network and is
    specified with `lxd init` on the remote host. Networking is enabled
    automatically when clustering is chosen.

Now confirm the successful addition of the cloud:

```bash
juju clouds
```

Here is a partial output:

```no-highlight
Cloud        Regions  Default          Type        Description
.
.
.
lxd-remote         1  default          lxd         LXD Container Hypervisor
```

#### Manually adding a remote LXD cloud

Alternatively, the remote LXD cloud can be added manually to Juju (see
[Adding clouds manually][clouds-adding-manually] for background information).

The manual method necessitates the use of a [YAML-formatted][yaml]
configuration file. Here is an example:

```yaml
clouds:
  lxd-remote-manual:
    type: lxd
    auth-types: [certificate]
    endpoint: https://10.55.60.244:8443
```

We've called the cloud 'lxd-remote-manual'. The endpoint is based on the
`HTTPS` protocoal, port 8443, and the IP address of the remote LXD host.

To add cloud 'lxd-remote-manual', assuming the configuration file is
`lxd-cloud.yaml` in the current directory, we would run:

```bash
juju add-cloud lxd-remote-manual lxd-cloud.yaml
```

### Adding credentials

As opposed to a local LXD cloud, in a remote context, credentials need to be
added prior to creating a controller (see [Cloud credentials][credentials] for
background information).

Use the `add-credential` command to add credentials to the new cloud:

```bash
juju add-credential lxd-remote
```

```no-highlight
Enter credential name: lxd-remote-creds

Auth Types
  certificate
  interactive

Select auth type [interactive]: 

Enter trust-password: *******

Loaded client cert/key from "/home/ubuntu/.local/share/juju/lxd"
Uploaded certificate to LXD server.

Credential "lxd-remote-creds" added locally for cloud "lxd-remote".
```

We've called the new credential 'lxd-remote-creds'. When prompted for
'trust-password', enter the password that was set up with `lxd init` on the
remote LXD host.

!!! Note:
    If the 'certificate' authentication type is chosen in place of
    'interactive' the server and client certificates and the client key will
    need to be gathered manually. You will be prompted for the paths to the
    three files containing the data.

#### Manually adding LXD credentials

Like adding a cloud manually, a YAML file is needed to manually add
credentials. Here is an example:

```yaml
credentials:
  lxd-remote:
    lxd-remote-creds:
      auth-type: interactive
      trust-password: ubuntu
```

Here, we've named the credential as we did when using the interactive method:
'lxd-remote-creds'. The trust password is set as 'ubuntu'.

To add credentials for cloud 'lxd-remote', assuming the configuration file is
`lxd-cloud-creds.yaml` in the current directory, we would run:

```bash
juju add-credential lxd-remote -f lxd-cloud-creds.yaml
```

### Next steps

Now that the cloud and credentials have been added the next step is to create a
controller. See [Creating a controller][clouds-lxd-creating-a-controller] on
the main LXD page.

## Charms and LXD profiles

Juju (`v.2.5.0`) allows charms to include a LXD profile. The profile will be
applied to a LXD container that the charm is deployed into. The following
functionality is built in:

 - A validity check is performed on the profile(s) during the deployment of the
   charm. This is based on a hardcoded list of allowed items, everything else
   being denied. The `--force` option can be used to bypass this check but this
   is not recommended. The list is:
   
```no-highlight
config
   -boot
   -limits
   -migration

devices
   unix-char
   unix-block
   gpu
   usb
```

 - Profiles are upgraded during the upgrade of the charm
   (`juju upgrade-charm`).
 - Profiles are displayed at the machine level by using either the
   `show-machine` command or the `status --format=yaml` command. Below is an
   example of the kind of information that can be obtained from either of these
   two commands:

```no-highlight
   lxd-profiles:
      juju-default-lxd-profile-0:
        config:
          environment.http_proxy: ""
          linux.kernel_modules: openvswitch,nbd,ip_tables,ip6_tables
          security.nesting: "true"
          security.privileged: "true"
        description: lxd profile for testing, black list items grouped commented out
        devices:
          bdisk:
            source: /dev/loop0
            type: unix-block
          sony:
            productid: 51da
            type: usb
            vendorid: 0fce
          tun:
            path: /dev/net/tun
            type: unix-char
```
