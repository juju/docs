Title: The Juju charm store

# The Juju Charm Store

Juju includes a charm store where charms and bundles can be uploaded,
published, and optionally shared with other users.

The charm store is broken down into two main sections: Recommended and
Community. Recommended charms have been vetted and reviewed by a Juju
Charmer and all updates to the charm are also vetted prior to landing.
Community charms have been shared by members of the community, but were
not submitted by and have not been vetted by Juju Charmers.

  - [Charm development information](developer-getting-started.html)
  - [Bundle creation information](charms-bundles.html)

In order to interact with the charm store you will need the latest
[charm command](tools-charm-tools.html), an
[Ubuntu SSO account](https://login.ubuntu.com/+login), and you must have
logged in to [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/+login) at least once.

## Log in to the store

It is required that you first log in to the
[Charmstore](https://jujucharms.com) before you attempt to log in via `charm
login`. After logging in via your browser, you can use the `charm`
command line tool.

Most charm commands require authentication in order to operate. You can
log in or log out of the store at any time by issuing `charm login` or
`charm logout` respectively. During login you will be prompted for the
following information:

 - `Username` - typically the email address used to access Ubuntu SSO
 - `Password` - Ubuntu SSO password
 - `Two-factor auth` - If enabled, enter two-factor authentication (2FA)
information. Otherwise <kbd>Return</kbd> for None

Also note, if your group memberships change on Launchpad, you'll need to
log out and log in via a browser to the
[Charmstore](https://jujucharms.com) before those membership changes are
recognized.

## Entities explained

When a charm or bundle, referred to as entity from this point forward, is
pushed for the first time to the store, the entity is named version 0 in
the unpublished channel. Every revision of an entity lives in the
unpublished channel. Subsequent pushes of different content to the store
will automatically increment this number. So if an entity is changed and
pushed 4 times, the revision history would look like this:

```
entity: 0---1---2---3
```

Channels group entity revisions into named streams. There are currently two
published channels: stable and development. Each channel also tracks
history of revisions. When a revision is published to a channel, that
channel pointer is changed and the history for the channel is updated.

Building on the previous example, when a user published revision 2 to the
stable channel, the history would look like this:

```
                  stable (2)
                 /
entity: 0---1---2---3
```

If, then, revision 3 is published to the development channel the history
would look like this:

```
                  stable (2)
                 /
entity: 0---1---2---3
                     \
                      development (3)
```

During this time, more revisions can be pushed to the default, unpublished
channel. This represents general development iterations. As iterations are
pushed during development, the stable and development channels are not
updated.


```
                  stable (2)
                 /
entity: 0---1---2---3---4---5---6
                     \
                      development (3)
```

The author can, at any time, publish a revision to a channel. Revisions
can also exist in the same channel at the same time. For example, the
author chooses to publish revision 3 to the stable channel without
updating the development channel:

```
                      stable (3, 2)
                     /
entity: 0---1---2---3---4---5---6
                     \
                      development (3)
```

In doing so, the stable channel is updated to point to revision 3 and
revision 3 is added to the channel history. The author can continue to
push and publish. Since revisions are a constant stream there are
scenarios where the stable channel may be pointed to a higher revision
even though development revision is actually newer.

In the following example revision 8 is development, a bug is found in the
latest stable revision (5) so a hot fix is applied and pushed as 9.
That revision is then published to the stable channel, like this:

```
                                              stable (9, 5, 3, 2)
                                             /
entity: 0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9
                                         \
                                          development (8, 3)
```

While authors can publish older versions to the channels it is not
encouraged. For example, an author could mistakenly publish revision 10 to
the stable channel and not development, then the author could re-publish
revision 9 to stable:

```
                                              stable (9, 10, 9, 5, 3, 2)
                                             /
entity: 0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---10
                                         \
                                          development (8, 3)
```

If a user managed to deploy that first mistaken revision during the time
it was available, they would later be notified of an "upgrade" by Juju
which will effectively downgrade the charm back to revision 9.

## Pushing to the store

After building a charm or bundle, navigate to it's directory on disk and
push it to the store.

```
cd src/charms/foobar
charm push .
```

The `charm push` command will return the full ID for the pushed item.
Since this is the first time foobar was pushed, the output of the command
is:

```
cs:~USER/foobar-0
```

If a charm or bundle id is not provided, they will default to
`cs:~USER/NAME` where `USER` is the `User` from the output of
`charm whoami` and `NAME` is the metadata.yaml `name` for charms and
directory basename for bundles.

To define a series or different bundle name an id can be provided during
push. The following is a set of different support permutations given the
following `charm whoami` output:

```
User: kirk
Group membership: charm-examples
```

User `kirk` can perform the following operations:

```
charm push .
charm push . charm-name
charm push . bundle/bundle-name
charm push . ~charm-examples/charm-name
charm push . cs:~charm-examples/charm-name
```

Push will always increment the charm version in the unpublished channel.

## Publishing to channels

The charm store supports two published channels: development and stable.
Revisions are associated with channels by using the publish charm command.
Publish is executed against an existing revision and places that revision
as the channel pointer.

Given the following example:

```
$ charm push . foo
cs:~kirk/foo-9
```

The author could publish foo-9 to either the stable or development channel
as follows, showing the commands for stable and development respectively:

```
charm publish cs:~kirk/foo-9
charm publish cs:~kirk/foo-9 --channel development
```

After running both commands, revision 9 exists in both the stable channel
and the development channel.

## Sharing charms and bundles

All channels (unpublished, development, and stable) have read and write
ACLs. By default, only the owner of the entity exists in these ACLs.

To update the ACL for an entity you must grant users an ACL to the channel
you want them to access. By default, if you do not supply an entity when
granting access, the recipient will receive only read access to the
stable channel, as in this example where we grant james access to the
stable channel of the cs:~kirk/foo entity.

```
charm grant cs:~kirk/foo james
```

If, instead you wanted to give write access to the development channel
to lars, you would issue the following command:

```
charm grant cs:~kirk/foo --channel development --acl write lars
```

Finally, to make the entity available for all to consume, there is a
special `everyone` user you can use to make an entity available to the
general public.

```
charm grant cs:~kirk/foo everyone
```
