Title: Juju Release Notes

# Release Notes History

This page details all available release notes for the 2.x series of Juju. The
release notes for the 1.x series are available [here][release-notes-1].

^# Juju 2.4-beta3
  
  A new development release of Juju is here, 2.4-beta3. Do not use on
  production systems.
  
  ## New and improved.

  The 'Relations' section in the `juju status` output has been cleaned up:

  - When filtering by application name, only direct relations are shown.
  - In tabular format, the 'Relations' section is no longer visible by default.
    Use the `--relations` option to see it (
    [LP 1633972](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1633972)).

  Empty `juju status` output has been clarified - whether it is due to a model
  being empty or because a provided filter did not match anything on the model
  ([LP 1255786](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1255786),
  [LP 1696245](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1696245),
  and [LP 1594883](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1594883)).

  There are four new model configuration keys affecting proxy behaviour.
  Existing model configuration for proxies remain unchanged, and any existing
  model or controller should not notice any changes. The new keys are:

  `juju-http-proxy`  
  `juju-https-proxy`  
  `juju-ftp-proxy`  
  `juju-no-proxy`
  
  These are used by the model for downloading charms, but are not set as the
  normal proxy environment variables for charm hook contexts, nor written as
  default systemd configuration values.
  
  The `juju-no-proxy` key can and should contain CIDR-formatted values for
  subnets. The controller machines are not added automatically to this key, so
  the internal network that is used should appear within it if there are other
  proxies set.
  
  The new proxy values are passed to the charm hook contexts as the following
  environment variables, respectively:
  
  `JUJU_CHARM_HTTP_PROXY`  
  `JUJU_CHARM_HTTPS_PROXY`  
  `JUJU_CHARM_FTP_PROXY`  
  `JUJU_CHARM_NO_PROXY`
  
  The charm helpers library will be gaining the ability to use proxies for
  certain activities. This is new behaviour and is still under development.
  
  The rationale behind this change is to better support proxies in situations
  where there are larger subnets, or multiple subnets, that should not be
  proxied. The traditional 'no_proxy' values cannot have CIDR values as they
  are not understood by many tools.

^# Juju 2.4-beta1
  
  A new development release of Juju is here, 2.4-beta1. Do not use on
  production systems.
  
  ## New and improved.
  
  **Model owner changes**  
  The concept of model owner is becoming obsolete. Model owner is just another
  model user with administrative access. We are working to remove any special
  access that the model owner has, and move to having the models in a namespace
  rather than grouped by owner.
  
  **Charm goal state**  
  Charm goal state allows charms to discover relevant information about their
  deployment. The key pieces of information a charm needs to discover are:
  
   - what other peer units have been deployed and their status
   - what remote units exist on the other end of each endpoint, and their status
  
  Charms use a new goal-state hook command to query the information about their
  deployment. This hook command will print only yaml or json output (default
  yaml):
  
  	  goal-state --format yaml
  
  The output will be a subset of that produced by the juju status command. There
  will be output for sibling (peer) units and relation state per unit.
  
  The unit status values are the workload status of the (sibling) peer units. We
  also use a unit status value of dying when the unit's life becomes dying. Thus
  unit status is one of:
  
   - allocating
   - active
   - waiting
   - blocked
   - error
   - dying
  
  The relation status values are determined per unit and depend on whether the
  unit has entered or left scope. The possible values are:
  
   - joining (relation created but unit not yet entered scope)
   - joined (unit has entered scope and relation is active)
   - broken (unit has left, or is preparing to leave scope)
   - suspended (parent cross model relation is suspended)
   - error
  
  By reporting error state, the charm has a chance to determine that goal state
  may not be reached due to some external cause. As with status, we will report
  the time since the status changed to allow the charm to empirically guess that
  a peer may have become stuck if it has not yet reached active state.
  
  **Controllers and remove-machine updates**  
  It is now possible to `juju remove-machine` a controller machine. As long as
  there is another controller, we will gracefully shut down the existing machine,
  and remove it from the HA set (of mongo, raft, and juju API servers).
  
  It is also possible to `juju remove-machine --force` for those conditions where
  the machine is not available to be gracefully removed. Currently this is not
  guaranteed to remove the machine from the Mongo replicaset, so it should be
  used only as a last resort.
  
  There is also a known issue that trying to `juju remove-machine` the machine
  that is currently the Mongo primary will not cleanup properly. This should be
  addressed in the next 2.4 release.
  
  In future 2.4 releases, we will also be updating `juju enable-ha` to remove its
  logic around demoting machines. Instead, `juju enable-ha` will only be a way to
  ensure that you have the correct number of controller machines being
  started/intended to participate in HA. This will also fix issues around
  launching 2 new machines (going to 5) while machines 2 and 3 are still
  starting.
  
  **Controller configuration options for spaces**  
  Two new controller configuration settings have been introduced. These are:
  
   - juju-mgmt-space
   - juju-ha-space
  
  'juju-mgmt-space' is the name of the network space used by agents to
  communicate with controllers. Setting a value for this item limits the IP
  addresses of controller API endpoints in agent config, to those in the space.
  If the value is misconfigured so as to expose no addresses to agents, then a
  fallback to all available addresses results. Juju client communication with
  controllers is unaffected by this value.
  
  'juju-ha-space' is the name of the network space used for MongoDB replica-set
  communication in high availability (HA) setups. This replaces the previously
  auto-detected space used for such communication. When enabling HA, this value
  must be set where member machines in a HA set have more than one IP address
  available for MongoDB use, otherwise an error will be reported. Existing HA
  replica sets with multiple available addresses will report a warning instead of
  an error provided the members and addresses remain unchanged.
  
  Using either of these options during `bootstrap` or `enable-ha` effectively
  adds constraints to machine provisioning. The commands will fail with an error
  if such constraints can not be satisfied.
  
  **Cloud credential changes**  
  Cloud credentials are used by models to authenticate communications with the
  underlying provider as well as to perform authorised operations on this
  provider. 
  
  Juju has always dealt with both cloud credentials stored locally on a user’s
  client machine as well as the cloud credentials stored remotely on a
  bootstrapped Juju controller. The distinction has not been made clear
  previously and this release addresses these ambiguities.
  
  	  juju show-model ...
  
  Basic cloud credential information such as its name and owner have been added
  to the command output. 
  
  	  juju show-credential ...
  
  This is a new command that shows a logged on user their remotely stored cloud
  credentials along with models that use them.
  
  See command help for more information.
  
  ## Fixes
  
  For a list of all bugs fixed in this release, see
  the [2.4-beta1 milestone](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.4-beta1).

^# Juju 2.3.1

  A new release of Juju is here, 2.3.1. This is primarily a bug fix release
  which addresses this critical upgrade issue:

  [LP 1737107](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1737107)

  Note, you may see a spurious message similar to
  `CRITICAL ********** SetModelAgentVersion: 2.3.1 false` while upgrading. This
  can be safely ignored and isn't present in 2.3.

^# Juju 2.3.0

  The Juju team are extremely pleased to announce the release of Juju 2.3. Juju
  is now more versatile, more efficient, and more configurable than ever.
   
  Cross Model Relations deliver a new way of organising your software stack.
  Deploy a database in one model and connect it to an application running
  another, even one running on a different controller, or even a different
  cloud.
   
  For containers at scale, Juju now integrates Canonical's Fan overlay network
  system. This allows containers to map network traffic to any other container
  on the fan network without distributed databases, consensus protocols, or any
  extra overhead.
  
  Juju's support for bundles has made it possible to quickly deploy connected
  sets of applications for some time now, but no two use cases are the same.
  That's why we have introduced the concept of an 'overlay' bundle - now you
  can easily add your own configuration and tweaks to a bundle at deploy time.
  See below for links to more information on this and other key features.
  
  ## How can I get it?
  
  The best way to get your hands on this release of Juju is to install it via
  snap packages (see https://snapcraft.io/ for more info on snaps).
  
         snap install juju --classic
  
  Other packages are available for a variety of platforms. Please see the
  online documentation at https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.3/reference-install.
  Those subscribed to a snap channel should be automatically upgraded. If
  you’re using the PPA or Homebrew, you should see an upgrade available.
  
  For highlights of this release, please see the documentation at
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.3/whats-new](./whats-new). Further details are

    - see https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.3/charms-storage#lxd-(lxd)
  
  ## Fixes
  
  * Listing of Juju models is more efficient and can now handle more models
    gracefully
  * Leadership coordinations is no longer tied to local time which avoids
    problems with clock skew and reduces overall load on the database 
  * Models are now more reliably destroyed and several fixes to avoid negative
    impacts while they are being removed

^# Juju 2.2.3

  ## New and Improved

  - The remove-machine command has a --keep-instance flag which allows the cloud
    instance to be left running when the machine is removed from the Juju model
  - Bundles can now reference local resources by specifying a relative path (as
    can already be done for local charms).
  - Values in local bundles for options and annotations can now specify a file to
    be read for the specified value. This is to support charm options where the
    value is some structured content, such as a configuration file. For binary
    external files, such as binary certificates, there is an option to base64
    encode the contents of the file so it can be used as a string value. The
    referenced file can include the path to the file. The file location is relative
    to the bundle file location.

    For example:

  <pre><code class="language-yaml">applications:
        my-app:
          charm: some-charm
          options:
            config: include-file://my-config.yaml
            cert: include-base64://my-cert.crt
  </code></pre><br/>

  -  There is a new option for deploying bundles: `--bundle-config`. This
     configuration file needs to be a YAML file, and currently only supports
     applications as a top level key. The format of the applications is the same
     as applications section in the bundle. Any values specified for an
     application in the bundle-config file override those values defined in the
     bundle, with the exception of the map type values, where the maps are merged
     with preference given to the bundle-config. The purpose of this to allow the
     use of a common bundle definition, and have model specific configuration kept
     in a separate file. Option and annotation values specified in the bundle-config
     file can also use the include-file:// and include-base64:// directives
     mentioned above for local bundles. Paths specified are relative to the
     bundle-config file.

^# Juju 2.2.1

  This release further enhances the performance improvements delivered in 2.2.0,
  as well as fixing some bugs that missed the cut for 2.2.0. Notable inclusions are:

    - Frequent database writes (for logging and agent pings) are batched to
      significantly reduce database I/O
    - Cleanup of log noise to make observing true errors much easier
    - Status history is now pruned whereas before a bug prevented that from
      happening leading to unbounded growth
    - update-status interval configurable (this value must be set when
      bootstrapping or performing add-model via the --config option; any changes
      after that are not noticed until a Juju restart)
    - debug-log include/exclude arguments now more user friendly (as for
      commands like juju ssh, you now specify machine/unit names instead of
      tags; "rabbitmq-server/0" instead of "unit-rabbitmq-server-0".

  conjure-up remains at version 2.2.0 but the snap has been updated to include
  this new Juju 2.2.1 version.

  ## Upgrading

  Changes introduced in 2.2.0 mean that you should also upgrade any
  controllers and hosted models after installing the new client software.
  Please see the documentation at
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.2/models-upgrade](./models-upgrade#upgrading-the-model-software)
  for more information.


  ## New and Improved

  * Users can now deploy workloads to Centos7 machines on Azure.
  * vSphere Juju users with vCenter 5.5 and vCenter 6.0 can now bootstrap
  successfully and deploy workloads as well as have machines organised into
  folders.
  * Juju now has initial support for Oracle Cloud, https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.2/help-oracle.
  * Users of Azure can now benefit from better credential management
  support, we’ve eliminated the need to manually discover subscription ID
  in order to add an Azure credential. All you need is to have Azure CLI
  installed and regular Juju credential management commands will “Just Work”.
  * Juju login command now accepts the name or hostname of a public controller
  as a parameter. Passing a user to log in as has been moved to an option
  rather than a positional parameter.
  * Behavior for a Juju bootstrap argument ‘-metadata-source’ has changed.
  In addition to specifying a parent directory that contains “tools” and
  “images” subdirectories with metadata, this argument can now also point
  directly to one of these subdirectories if only one type of custom metadata
  is required. (lp:1696555)
  * Actions that require ‘sudo’ can now be used in conjure-up steps.
  * conjure-up now uses libjuju as its api client.
  * conjure-up can now deploy from release channels, e.g. 'beta'.
  * There's a new bootstrap configuration option, max-txn-log-size, that can
  be used to configure the size of the capped transaction log used internally
  by Juju. Larger deployments needed to be able to tune this setting; we
  don't recommend setting this option without careful consideration.
  * General Juju log pruning policy can now be configured to specify maximum
  log entry age and log collection size, https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.2/controllers-config.
  * Juju status history pruning policy can also be configured to specify
  maximum status entry age and status collection size,
  https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.2/models-config.
  * The  'status --format=yaml' and 'show-machine' commands now show more
  detailed information about individual machines' network configuration.
  * Added support for AWS ‘ap-northeast-2’ region, and GCE ‘us-west1’,
  ‘asia-northeast1’ regions.
  * Actions have received some polish and can now be canceled, and showing a
  previously run action will include the name of the action along with the
  results.
  * Rotated Juju log files are now also compressed.
  * Updates to MAAS spaces and subnets can be made available to a Juju model
  using the new ‘reload-spaces’ command.
  * ‘unit-get private-address’ now uses the default binding for an application.
  * Juju models have always been internally identified by their owner and
  their short name. These full names have not been exposed well to the user
  but are now part of juju models and show-model command output.

  ## Fixes

  * Juju more reliably determines whether to connect to the MAASv2 or MAASv1
  API based on MAAS endpoint URL as well as the response received from MAAS.
  * Juju is now built with Go version 1.8 to take advantage of performance
  improvements.
  * Juju users will no longer be missing their firewall rules when adding
  a new machine on Azure.
  * Juju models with storage can now be cleanly destroyed.
  * Juju is now resilient to a MITM attack as SSH Keys of the bootstrap host
  are now verified before bootstrap (lp:1579593).
  * Root escalation vulnerability in ‘juju-run’ has been fixed (lp:1682411).
  * Juju’s agent presence data is now aggressively pruned, reducing
  controller disk space usage and avoiding associated performance issues.
  * MAAS 2.x block storage now works with physical disks, when MAAS reports
  the WWN unique identifier. (lp:1677001).
  * Automatic bridge names are now properly limited to 15 characters in
  Juju (lp:1672327).
  * Juju subordinate units are now removed as expected when their principal
  is removed (lp:1686696 and lp:1655486)

  conjure-up bugs we have fixed:

  https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.2.0
  https://github.com/conjure-up/conjure-up/milestone/19?closed=1

  ## Known issues

  * Juju 2.1 agents can fail if configuration for the units is large enough
  to cause responses to be chunked. https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/2.1/+bug/1697936
  * Restarting controller during an HA upgrade will cause it to not upgrade.

^# Juju 2.1.3

  This release fixes a privilege escalation vulnerability when executing
  `juju-run` on the cloud instances, not to be confused with the
  'juju run' CLI command.

  See the following for further details on the vulnerability:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1682411
  CVE-2017-9232 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9232

  This vulnerability affects all currently distributed versions of
  Juju (1.25.x, 2.0.x and 2.1.x).

  ## How to know if you need to update

  We’ve put together a helpful Python script that will loop through your
  controllers and then output the version of each model on the controller.
  It requires Python 2.7 or higher.

        curl -L https://goo.gl/59gxnz | python

  ## How do I update? I’m on…


  ### JAAS
  JAAS has been updated to the new 2.1.3 release. Users with models in
  JAAS do not need to perform any upgrade steps to their models that
  are running in JAAS.

  ### Juju 2.2-betaX
  Users of the 2.2-beta releases need to temporarily update to using
  the edge channel. Users will need to use this until Juju 2.2-rc1
  is released in the coming days. You can easily switch your snap install
  client by using the following:

        snap refresh juju --edge --classic

  Once you’ve completed this step you’ll need to run through the normal upgrade
  steps on your models, as explained
  [in the documentation](./models-upgrade#the-upgrade-juju-command)

  Note for non-snap beta users: we suggest you do not run controllers with
  the 2.2 beta releases. We suggest you move to the edge channel of the
  snap releases or to wait and redeploy when 2.2 RC1 is released.

  ### Juju 2.1.x

  You can follow the current upgrade documentation to upgrade. Make sure that
  you update your controller model as well as each model on that controller.

  Or install Juju from the snap store:

    snap install juju --classic

  Install conjure-up from the snap store:

    snap install conjure-up --classic

  If you are on Trusty, you'll need to run a few extra commands:

    sudo apt-get install snapd

^# Juju 2.1.1

  ## What's new in 2.1.1

  - Networking improvements
  - [conjure-up] Spells support side-loading bundles. This helps spells
    authors who are writing spells for particular software but want to
    offer variations. For example, there are OpenStack bundles that
    support both KVM and LXD, or Telemetry additions. Side-loading will
    help with spells that need to provide those various bundle
    configurations.
  - [conjure-up] More LXD improvements in addition to support for the
     recently released LXD 2.10.


  ### Networking improvements

  - containers now respect static routes from MAAS. The static routes
    defined for the subnets that the containers are in should should be
    set for the containers as well.
  - 'lxdbr0' subnet selection has changed from a simple incremental search
    to randomized selection across 10.0.X. It also now properly handles
    when an active subnet spans more than just a /24.
  - better handling of http_proxy and no_proxy when interacting with LXD
  - errors while trying to set up networking for containers are properly
    reported as provisioning errors, instead of falling back to 'lxdbr0'.
    This mostly impacts MAAS deployments where they would end up with
    containers that were not addressable, and the actual failure was
    buried in log files.

^# Juju 2.1.0

  ## What's new in 2.1.0

  - Model migration
  - Interactive `add-cloud`
  - Networking changes
  - Conjure-up
  - LXD credential changes
  - Changes to the GUI
  - Instrumentation of Juju via Prometheus endpoints
  - Improved OpenStack keystone v3 authentication
  - New cloud-regions supported
  - Additional improvements


  ### Model migration

  Model migration allows you to easily move a live model from one
  controller to another. The same configuration of machines, units and
  their relationships will be replicated on a secondary controller, while
  your applications continue uninterrupted.

  Migration is a useful alternative to upgrading a controller in place,
  and for moving models off a busy controller. When upgrading a
  controller, you can bootstrap a new controller running a newer version
  of Juju and then migrate each model across one at a time. This is safer
  than upgrading a controller while it is running many applications.

  Currently there are some restrictions:

    - The source and destination controllers need to be in the same cloud
      environment.
    - The destination controller needs to be running on the same cloud
      substrate as the source controller.
    - Destination controllers on different regions or VPCs need direct
      connectivity to the source controller.
    - The version of Juju running on the destination controller needs to
      be the same or newer than the version on the source controller.
    - The controller model cannot be migrated.

  To migrate a model on the current controller to a model on another
  controller, you simply name the model as the first argument followed by
  the target controller (a model with the same name cannot already exist
  on the target controller):

      juju migrate <model-name> <target-controller-name>

  This will initiate the migration with output similar to the following:

      Migration started with ID "d1924666-1b00-4805-89b5-5ed5a6744426:0"

  You can monitor the migration progress from the output of the juju
  status command run against the source model. The juju show-model command
  also shows migration progress.

  If the migration fails at any point, the model will be reactivated on
  the original controller in the same state it was in before the migration
  process was started. The duration of a migration will depend on the
  complexity of the model, the resources it uses and the capabilities of
  the hosted environment. Most migrations will take minutes, and even
  large deployments are unlikely to take hours.

  When complete, the model will no longer exist on the source controller,
  and the model, all its applications, machines and units will be running
  from the target controller.

  Use `juju switch` to select the migrated model in the destination
  controller:

      juju switch <target controller>:<model>
      juju status

  There is more information on model migration in the Juju documentation
  online at
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/models-migrate](./models-migrate.html)


  ### Interactive `add-cloud`

  With previous versions of Juju, the `add-cloud` command would need to be
  fed a specifically formatted YAML file if your cloud of choice wasn't
  directly supported by Juju. You can still do this, but from version 2.1,
  you can also step through a simple interactive process that will create
  a working configuration for you.

  Typing `juju add-cloud` starts the process and produces the following
  output:

      Cloud Types
        maas
        manual
        openstack
        vsphere

      Select cloud type:

  Simply answer the three or four questions for your new cloud and Juju
  will do the rest. The next step is to add credentials for this new
  cloud, which can be done with the similarly interactive command:

      juju add-credentials

  Again, follow the prompts to add the requested information.

  A more detailed walkthrough of the process is published in the online
  Juju documentation here:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/clouds#specifying-additional-clouds](./clouds.html#specifying-additional-clouds)


  ### Networking changes

  A number of changes have been introduced to make the use of networks,
  particularly networking of containers, more efficient and consistent in
  Juju.

  Juju models networks using the primitive of "spaces". A space is made up
  of one or more routable subnets with common ingress and egress rules.
  The operator can model this topology in such a way that applications
  have the required network connectivity without generating network IP
  maps of overwhelming complexity that are not portable.

  The default behaviour in Juju 2.0 was that all machines might host
  containers and so all interfaces were bridged by default, even if a
  container was never placed on the machine. If a container was placed on
  the machine all of the network devices of that machine were made
  available to each container. This led to issues where the operator
  wanted a much cleaner model where the containers only had access to
  networks that the model required. Starting from Juju 2.1 this will no
  longer be true. Juju will only create the bridges which are necessary
  for a container to operate in the model.

  The changes in 2.1 require operators to be more specific about what
  network space a charm should operate in (this is particularly relevant
  to charms deployed to containers on Juju machines) when more than one
  space is available on the machine. Defining what spaces the container is
  required to operate in is is already supported by the '--bind' option of
  the deploy command, which can be used to specify that of the charm
  should operate within the same space, e.g.:

      juju deploy mysql --bind db-space

  ...or, you can specify which charm defined endpoints should end up in
  specific spaces:

      juju deploy mysql --bind "db:db-space db-admin:admin-space default-space"

  ...which also includes a default option for any other interfaces not
  specified.

  These changes potentially impact on currently published bundles. Bundles
  that might have assumed that a container has access to all of the same
  spaces as the host machine will no longer deploy cleanly. They need to
  be updated to be more specific about the bindings required. The above
  deploy commands can be mirrored in bundle format like so:

      mysql:
         charm: "cs:mysql"
         num_units: 1
         bindings:
           “”: default-space
           db: db-space
           db-admin: admin-space

  There is more information on binding to spaces in the online Juju
  documentation
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/charms-deploying#deploying-with-binding](./charms-deploying.html#deploying-with-binding)

  Defining spaces within Juju is covered in the documentation here:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/network-spaces](./network-spaces.html)

  Information on adding bindings to charm bundles is also documented online:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/charms-bundles#binding-endpoints-of-applications-within-a-bundle](./charms-bundles.html#binding-endpoints-of-applications-within-a-bundle)

  These changes and the rationale behind them were originally posted to
  the juju-dev mailing list. If you require further background or have
  questions or concerns, please add to the discussion on the mailing list.

  ### Conjure-up

  Conjure-up, the big-software deployment tool that leverages Juju, has
  seen some major improvements in-line with Juju development. A new
  `conjure-down` command can be used to easily teardown models, and
  there's support for Canonical Kubernetes 1.5.2 and Kubernetes 1.5.2,
  which can be deployed to the local LXD provider. Several ‘big-data’
  spells have been added - see them with ‘conjure-up bigdata’-  and
  there’s a new ‘Architect’ button which allows editing machine placement,
  including allocation to a MAAS machine.

  For more details, take a look at the updated Conjure-up user guide:
  <http://conjure-up.io/docs/en/users/>


  ### [juju] LXD credentials

  Juju now support credentials to access controllers on remote LXD hosts.
  If you are just bootstrapping and adding models on your laptop there is
  no change in workflow, but there is a change if you want to add models
  from another machine.

  Users are now expected to have a "certificate" credential for creating
  LXD models. If you are on the LXD host, bootstrap and add-model will
  both auto-generate a credential as needed, assuming you have access to
  the LXD Unix socket.

  When working with remote users on different machines, LXD-hosted
  controllers need to to manually import the certificate credential from
  the host machine.

  To do this, first run juju autoload-credentials on the LXD host. This
  will generate output similar to the following:

      Looking for cloud and credential information locally...

      1. LXD credential "localhost" (new)
      Select a credential to save by number, or type Q to quit:

  Select the LXD credential (1 in the above example) and you will be asked
  for the name of a cloud to link to this credential. Enter "localhost" to
  specify the local LXD deployment. When the prompt re-appears, type "q"
  to quit. The new certificate credential will have been created.

  To export this certificate credential to a file called
  localhost-credentials.yaml,
  type the following:

      juju credentials localhost --format=yaml > localhost-credentials.yaml

  The output file now needs to be moved to the machine and account that
  requires access to the local LXD deployment. With this file on the
  remote machine, the certificate credential can be imported with the
  following command:

      juju add-credential localhost -f localhost-credentials.yaml


  ### [juju] Instrumentation of Juju via Prometheus endpoints

  Starting with Juju 2.1 each Juju controller provides an HTTPS endpoint
  to expose Prometheus metrics. To feed these metrics into Prometheus, you
  must add a new scrape target to your already installed and running
  Prometheus instance. For this use case, the only constraint on where
  Prometheus is running is that Prometheus must be able to contact the
  Juju controller's API server address/port.

  A more detailed walkthrough of the process is published in the online
  Juju documentation here:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/howto-prometheus](./howto-prometheus.html)


  ### [juju] Changes to the GUI

  The `juju gui` command has changed to improve the user experience. By
  default this command now uses the old 'no-browser' behaviour (i.e. it
  doesn't automatically open the URL in your default web browser) and also
  displays the login credential. There is a new --hide-credential option
  not to show the credential.

  The --no-browser option is supported but deprecated (it is effectively a
  no-op). To bring up a browser, use the --browser option. For example, to
  output the URL and credential, run:

      juju gui

  To print the Juju GUI URL only:

      juju gui --hide-credential

  To open the Juju GUI in the default browser and show admin credential
  used to log into it:

      juju gui --browser

  Juju now supports the new model path based URLs; these replace the URLs
  containing the model UUID. So if you know the owner and name of a model,
  you can easily point a browser to the following location to access the
  GUI for that model:

      https://<controller-ip>:17070/gui/u/<owner>/<modelname>/

  There is more information on using the built-in GUI in the online
  documentation at:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.1/controllers-gui](./controllers-gui.html)


  ### [juju] Improved Openstack keystone v3 authentication

  Juju now supports authentication for project and domain scopes. The
  following environment variables or ~/.novarc attributes are supported:

  - OS_DOMAIN_NAME
    domain name of the requested domain level authorisation scope
  - OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME
    domain name of the user
  - OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME
    domain name of the requested project level authorisation scope
  - OS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME
    common domain name of the user and project

  The Juju autoload-credentials command may be used to import credential
  attributes from either environment variables or ~/.novarc into the Juju
  credential store.

  See the online Openstack documentation here:
  <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/>


  ### [juju] New cloud-regions supported

  Juju supports two more Google region and six more Azure regions:
  - google/us-west1
  - google/asia-northeast1
  - azure/canadacentral
  - azure/canadaeast
  - azure/uksouth
  - azure/ukwest
  - azure/westcentralus
  - azure/westus2


  ### [juju] Additional improvements

  - Manual cloud provisioning now supports CentOS machines
  - Deployments to LXD containers on Xenial use the more performant
    directory backend https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1648513
  - Constraints placed on KVM containers in bundles are honoured

^# Juju 2.0.4

  ## Resolved Issues

  Fixes vulnerability CVE-2017-9232:

  Privilege escalation vulnerability when executing `juju-run` on the cloud
  instances, not to be confused with the `juju run` CLI command.
   
  See the following for further details:

  - https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1682411
  - http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9232
   
  This vulnerability affects all currently distributed versions of Juju (1.25.x,
  2.0.x and 2.1.x).
   
  ## How to know if you need to update
   
  We’ve put together a helpful Python script that will loop through your
  controllers and then output the version of each model on the controller. It
  requires Python 2.7 or higher.
   
  `curl -L https://goo.gl/59gxnz | python`
   
  ## How do I update? I’m on...
   
  **JAAS**  
  JAAS has been updated to the new 2.1.3 release. Users with models in JAAS do
  not need to perform any upgrade steps to their models that are running in JAAS.
   
  **Juju 2.2-betaX**  
  Users of the 2.2-beta releases need to temporarily update to using the edge
  channel. Users will need to use this until Juju 2.2-rc1 is released in the
  coming days. You can easily switch your snap install client by using the
  following:
   
  `snap refresh juju --edge --classic`
   
  Once you’ve completed this step you’ll need to run through the normal upgrade
  steps on your models, as explained in the documentation: 
   
  https://jujucharms.com/docs/models-upgrade#the-upgrade-juju-command

^# Juju 2.0.0

  ## Notable Changes

  Juju 2.0 is a fundamental step forward from the previous 1.x series,
  introducing significant new features and capabilities, including:

    * Integrated GUI
    * Better cloud management
    * Multi-user support
    * Baked-in knowledge of public clouds
    * Uses LXD for fast and efficient local experience
    * More efficient Controller/Model arrangement
    * More intuitive CLI experience

  An overview of these features is discussed below - for full
  documentation, please visit our docs online at:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs](https://jujucharms.com/docs/)

  ### Integrated GUI

  The GUI is now included with your Juju install. To open the GUI run:

        juju gui --show-credentials

  It will open the GUI in your browser and output your credentials to
  the console for logging in. When a new version of the GUI is released to upgrade:

        juju upgrade-gui

  ### Juju 2.0 is co-installable with Juju 1.25

  The directory where Juju stores its working data has changed to
  follow the XDG directory specification. By default, the Juju data
  directory is located at ~/.local/share/juju. You may override this
  by setting the JUJU_DATA environment variable.

  Juju 2.0's data is not compatible with Juju 1.x.
  **Do not** set `JUJU_DATA` to the old `JUJU_HOME` (~/.juju).

  ### New bootstrap and cloud management experience

  This release introduces a new way of bootstrapping and managing clouds
  and credentials that involves less editing of files and makes Juju work
  out of the box with major public clouds like AWS, Azure, Google,
  Rackspace, Joyent, and Cloudsigma.

  Clouds and credentials are managed separately making it easier to
  use different credentials for a single cloud.

  See: https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/controllers-creating

  #### LXD cloud support

  Using the LXD cloud is the fastest way to get started with Juju
  locally using secure local containers. Use our getting-started guide
  to setup LXD and start modeling your operations.

  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/getting-started](./getting-started.html)

  #### Public clouds

  To see what clouds are available, use:

        juju clouds

      Cloud        Regions  Default        Type        Description
      aws               11  us-east-1      ec2         Amazon Web Services
      aws-china          1  cn-north-1     ec2         Amazon China
      aws-gov            1  us-gov-west-1  ec2         Amazon (USA Government)
      azure             18  centralus      azure       Microsoft Azure
      azure-china        2  chinaeast      azure       Microsoft Azure China
      cloudsigma         5  hnl            cloudsigma  CloudSigma Cloud
      google             4  us-east1       gce         Google Cloud Platform
      joyent             6  eu-ams-1       joyent      Joyent Cloud
      rackspace          6  dfw            rackspace   Rackspace Cloud
      localhost          1  localhost      lxd         LXD Container Hypervisor


  ##### update-clouds command

  Canonical will publish new public cloud data to reflect new
  regions or changed endpoints in the list of public clouds supported
  by Juju. To update your Juju environment, use this:

        juju update-clouds

  The newly downloaded cloud information will be used next time a
  Juju controller is bootstrapped.

  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds](./clouds.html)


  #### Credential management

  To access your cloud, Juju must be able to authenticate to it.
  Credentials are defined per cloud. Juju can guide you through
  adding a new credential like so:

        juju add-credential aws

  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/credentials](./credentials.html)


  #### Manual, MAAS, and OpenStack clouds

  For manual, MAAS, and OpenStack clouds, it is necessary to create a YAML
  file and then run 'juju add-cloud' to add these to Juju.

  Assuming you have a file called "personal-clouds.yaml" detailing an
  OpenStack cloud called "homestack", use this to add the cloud
  to Juju:

        juju add-cloud homestack personal-clouds.yaml

  To bootstrap that OpenStack cloud:

        juju bootstrap homestack

  For more details see [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds](./clouds.html)


  #### Bootstrap constraints and series

  While bootstrapping, you can now specify constraints for the bootstrap
  machine independently of the constraints used for deployed applications:

        juju bootstrap --constraints mem=2G --bootstrap-constraints "mem=32G cores=4" aws

  You may also specify the operating system series of the bootstrap machine:

        juju bootstrap --bootstrap-series trusty aws


  #### Model configuration at bootstrap

  When bootstrapping, it is sometimes necessary to pass in
  configuration values. You may specify config values as bootstrap
  arguments or via a file:

        juju bootstrap aws --config image-stream=daily

  Values as name pairs take precedence over the content of any file
  specified. Example:

        juju bootstrap aws --config image-stream=daily --config
            /path/to/file

  To specify a different name for the initial hosted model created during bootstrap:

        juju bootstrap aws --default-model mymodel

  ### Shared model config

  Configuration can now be shared between models. The three separate
  commands (get-model-config, set-model-config, and unset-model-config)
  have been collapsed into a single command.

  New/changed commands relevant to this feature:
    - juju model-config
    - juju controller-config
    - juju show-model
    - juju model-defaults

  The management of hosted model configuration has been improved in several ways:
    - shared config can be defined which will be used for all new models
      unless overridden by the user, either at model creation time using
      --config arguments or using juju model-config later
    - output of juju model-config includes the origin of each attribute
      value ("default", "controller", "region", or "model")
    - output of juju model config only shows configuration relevant to
      controlling the behaviour of a model;
    - other data, e.g. model name, UUID, cloud type etc are shown using
      juju show-model
    - controller specific details like api port, certificates etc are now
      available using juju controller-config

  There are 4 sources of model attribute values:
    1. default - hard coded into Juju or the cloud provider
    2. controller - shared by all models created on controller
    3. region - shared by all models running in a given cloud region
    4. model - set by the user

  ##### Model config command examples

  When bootstrapping, it is sometimes necessary to pass in configuration
  values. You may specify config values as bootstrap arguments or via a file:

        juju bootstrap aws --config image-stream=daily

  Values as name pairs take precedence over the content of any file specified. Example:

        juju bootstrap aws --config image-stream=daily --config
            /path/to/file

  To specify a different name for the hosted model:

        juju bootstrap aws --default-model mymodel

  An example juju model-config output:

  Attribute                     From     Value
  agent-metadata-url            default  ""
  agent-stream                  model    devel
  agent-version                 model    2.0.0
  apt-ftp-proxy                 default  ""
  ...

  Points of note are that:
    - all model attributes are shown, enabling the user to see what values
      are available to be set
    - when a new model is created, the values are forked at that time so
      that any Juju upgrades which come with different hard coded defaults
      do not affect existing models.
    - the FROM value is calculated dynamically so that if a default value
      changes to match the model, the output is adjusted accordingly

  The behaviour of juju model-config --reset has changed. Previously,
  any reset attribute would revert to the empty value. Now, the
  value will revert to the closest inherited value.

  #### Model defaults

  Shared controller config attributes can be specified in the clouds.yaml file. For example:

      clouds:
      lxdtest:
        type: lxd
        config:
          bootstrap-timeout: 900
          set-numa-control-policy: true
          ftp-proxy: http://local

  After deployment the `model-defaults` command allows a user to:
    - set and unset shared controller attributes
    - display the values of shared attributes used when creating models, and
      where those attributes are defined (default, controller, or region)
    - allow shared attributes to be specified for each cloud region (where    
      they exist) instead of just the controller.

  ##### Model default command examples

  Retrieve the full set of configuration defaults (some content elided for brevity).

      juju model-defaults

      Attribute                   Default           Controller
      agent-metadata-url          ""                -
      agent-stream                released          -
      apt-ftp-proxy               ""                -
      ...
      logging-config              ""                <root>=TRACE
      no-proxy                    ""                https://local
      us-east-1                 foobar            -
      us-west-1                 https://foo-west  -
      provisioner-harvest-mode    destroyed         -
      proxy-ssh                   false             -
      resource-tags               ""                -
      ...

  Set the default configuration value for all models in the controller for key to value and key2 to value2.

      juju model-defaults key=value key2=value2

  Retrieve just the value for a single key:

      juju model-defaults key

      ATTRIBUTE    DEFAULT           CONTROLLER
      key          ""                shrubbery
      us-east-1  value             -
      us-west-1  foobaz            -

  Retrieve just the value for a single region:

      juju model-defaults us-east-1

      ATTRIBUTE    DEFAULT           CONTROLLER
      key          ""                shrubbery
      us-east-1  value             -

  Reset the value of key and key2 to the next closest default value:

      juju model-defaults --reset key,key2

  As with model-config values can be reset and set in one command.

      juju model-defaults --reset key key2=value2

  ### Juju controllers

  A Juju controller provides the HTTP API to Juju and handles
  all of the state information for each model running.

  A controller is created by the “juju bootstrap” command. A single
  Juju controller can now manage many Juju models, meaning less
  resources are needed for Juju's management infrastructure than
  with Juju 1.x, and new models can be created instantly.

  Controllers have a name. By default, Juju will name the controller
  after the cloud and region on which it is running:

      juju bootstrap aws

      Creating Juju controller "aws-us-east-1" on aws/us-east-1
      …

  It is also possible to give the controller a name:

      juju bootstrap aws prod

      Creating Juju controller "prod" on aws/us-east-1
      …

  The relevant controller and model commands are:

        juju bootstrap
        juju controllers
        juju models
        juju switch
        juju add-model
        juju destroy-model
        juju destroy-controller

  To learn about managing controllers and models, see:

  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/controllers](./controllers.html)
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/models](./models.html)


  #### Juju GUI in the controller

  The Juju GUI is now included in every Juju controller after
  bootstrapping, eliminating the need to deploy a Juju GUI charm.

  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/controllers-gui](./controllers-gui.html)


  #### Creating new models

  Controller admin users can create new models without needing to specify
  any additional configuration:

        juju add-model mynewmodel

  In such cases, the new model will inherit the credentials and SSH authorized
  keys of the controller.

  Other users are required to specify a named credential (so that resources
  created by the new model are allocated to the cloud account of the model
  creator):

        juju add-model mynewmodel --credential myAWScreds

  Additional configuration for the new model may also be specified:

        juju add-model --config image-stream=daily


  #### Sharing models

  It is now possible to give other people access to models. Users may be granted
  read, write, or admin access to a model.

  To grant access to a new user they need to be added first
  using the `add-user` command:

        juju add-user jo

  Grant tracy access to production-cms.

        juju grant tracy write production-cms

  Grant jo admin admin access on staging-cms.

        juju grant jo admin staging-cms

  Additional command support revoking permissions and disabling users. To learn more, see:
  [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/users](./users.html)


  ### Controller and model permissions

  A user can be given one of three permission levels on each model in a controller:

    * read: The user can log in to the model and obtain status and information about it.
    * write: The user can deploy/delete services and add relations in a model.
    * admin: The user has full control over the model except for controller level
    actions such as deletion. Model owners can delete their own models.

  Three permission levels have also been added for users on controllers:

    * login: Allows the user to log in to the controller.
    * add-model: Allows the user to create new models.
    * superuser: Allows the user full control over the model
    (this permission is granted automatically to the creator of a model).


  ### Improvements in charms and bundles

  #### Native support for charm bundles

  The Juju 'deploy' command is used to deploy a bundle. A bundle is a
  collection of charms, configuration, and other characteristics that can
  be deployed in a consistent manner.

  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/charms-bundles](./charms-bundles.html)


  #### Multi-series charms

  Charms may now declare that they support more than one operating
  system series. Previously a separate version of a charm was required
  for each series. To specify the series to use when deploying a charm,
  use the ‘--series’ flag:

        juju deploy mysql --series trusty

  If '--series' is not specified the default is used. The default series
  for a multi-series charm is the first one specified in the charm metadata.
  If the specified series is not supported by the charm the deploy will abort
  with an error, unless '--force' is used.


  #### Improved local charm deployment

  Local charms and bundles can be deployed directly from their source
  directory. This feature makes it convenient to hack on a charm and
  just deploy it. The feature is also necessary to develop local charms
  supporting multiple series.

  For example, to deploy a development copy of magic-charm from a local
  repo, targeting the yakkety series:

        juju deploy ./dev/juju/magic-charm --series yakkety

  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/charms-deploying](./charms-deploying.html)

  Any directory structure can be used, including simply pulling the
  charm source from a version control system, hacking on the code, and
  deploying directly from the local repo.


  #### Resources

  In charms, "resources" are binary blobs that the charm can utilize, and
  are declared in the metadata for the charm. All resources declared will
  have a version stored in the Charm Store, however updates to these can
  be uploaded from an admin's local machine to the controller.


  ##### Change to metadata

  A new clause has been added to metadata.yaml for resources. Resources
  can be declared as follows:

      resources:
        name:
          type: file                         # the only type initially
          filename: filename.tgz
          description: "One line that is useful when operators need to push it."

  ##### New commands related to resources

  To show the resources required by or in use by an
  existing application or unit in your model:


        juju resources

  To upload a file from your local disk to the Juju controller
  to be used as a resource for a application.

        juju push-resource <application> name=<filename>

  #### New charmer concepts

  #####  Charms can declare minimum Juju version

  There is a new (optional) top level field in the metadata.yaml
  file called min-juju-version. If supplied, this value specifies
  the minimum version of a Juju server with which the charm is compatible.

  Note that, at this time, Juju 1.25.x does *not* recognize this
  field, so charms using this field will not be accepted by 1.25
  environments.


  ##### Expansion of the upgrade-charm hook

  Whenever a charm or any of its required resources are updated,
  the 'upgrade-charm' hook will fire. A resource is updated whenever
  a new copy is uploaded to the charm store or controller.


  ##### resource-get

  Use 'resource-get' while a hook is running to get the local
  path to the file for the identified resource. This file is an
  fs-local copy, unique to the unit for which the hook is running.
  It is downloaded from the controller, if necessary.

  #### application-version-set

  Charm authors may trigger this command from any hook to output
  what version of the application is running. This could be a package
  version, for instance postgres version 9.5. It could also be a
  build number or version control revision identifier, for instance
  "git sha 6fb7ba68". The version details will then be displayed in juju status
  output with the application details.

  Example (within a charm hook):

        application-version-set 9.5.3

  Then application status will show:

      App         Version  Status  Scale  Charm       Store       Rev  OS      Notes
      postgresql  9.5.3    active      1  postgresql  jujucharms  105  ubuntu  

  #### Juju supports Charm Store channels

  Support for channels has been brought into Juju via command options on the
  relevant sub-commands:

        juju deploy
        juju upgrade-charm

  For more information on the new support for channels in the Charm Store
  and how they work, please see our
  [documentation](./authors-charm-store.html#entities-explained)
  on the subject.

  #### extra-bindings Support for charms metadata

  Many charms use a simple model where a relationship with another charm
  also indicates there is a network connection between units of those
  applications. We have utilized this fact to add a network model that allows
  system operators to control where those TCP connections are made by
  binding the application relation endpoints onto a network space.

  However, some charms specifically use relation endpoints only as a way
  to pass configuration around, and the relations don't map directly to
  applications that are running in that charm and/or networking configuration.
  These charms want to be able to express that they have more networking
  configuration that an operator wants to control without having yet-
  another interface that will never be related to another application.

  Juju solves the aforementioned issues by introducing an optional new
  section in the charm metadata,yaml. The new section is called "extra-
  bindings". Similarly to the peers/provides/requires sections, extra-
  bindings contains a list of names, which can be used with 'juju deploy
  --bind' like relation names. Unlike relations, you don't have to define
  hooks or anything more complex to allow the users of the charm to bind
  those names to Juju spaces.

  #### New hook command: network-get

  When deploying an application with endpoint bindings specified, charm
  authors can use the new "network-get" hook command to determine which
  address to advertise for a given endpoint. This approach will eventually
  replace "unit-get private-address" as well as various other ways to get
  the address to use for a given unit.

  There is currently a mandatory '--primary-address' argument to 'network-
  get', which guarantees a single IP address to be returned.

  Example (within a charm hook):

      relation-ids cluster
      url:2

      network-get url:2 --primary-address
      10.20.30.23

  (assuming the application was deployed with e.g. --bind url=internal, and
  (10.20.30.0/24 is one of the subnets in that "internal" space).


  ### New spaces support on MAAS 1.9, 2.0, 2.1

  Juju 2.0 now natively supports the spaces API in MAAS 1.9+. Spaces
  are automatically discovered from MAAS (1.9+) on bootstrap and available
  for use with application endpoint bindings or machine provisioning
  constraints (see below). Space discovery works for the controller model
  as well as any model created later using 'juju add-model'.


  #### Binding application endpoints to spaces

  Binding means the "bound" endpoints will have IP addresses from
  subnets that are part of the space the endpoint is bound to.

  Use the optional '--bind' argument when deploying an application to
  specify to which space individual charm endpoints should be bound. The
  syntax for the '--bind' argument is a whitespace-separated list of
  endpoint and space names, separated by "=".

  When `--bind` is not specified, all endpoints will use the same
  address, which is the host machine's preferred private address, as
  returned by "unit-get private-address".
  This is backwards-compatible behaviour.

  Additionally, an application-default space can be specified by omitting
  the `<endpoint>=` prefix before the space name. This space will
  be used for binding all endpoints that are not explicitly specified.

  Examples:

        juju deploy mysql --bind "db=database server=internal"

  Bind "db" endpoint to an address part of the "database" space (i.e. the
  address is coming from one of the "database" space's subnets in MAAS).

        juju deploy wordpress --bind internal-apps

  Bind *all* endpoints of wordpress to the "internal-apps" space.

        juju deploy haproxy --bind "url=public internal"

  Bind "url" to "public", and all other endpoints to "internal".


  ### Provider improvements

  #### LXC local provider no longer available

  With the introduction of the LXD provider (below), the LXC version of
  the local provider is no longer supported.


  #### LXD provider

  The new LXD provider is the best way to use Juju locally.
  See: [https://jujucharms.com/docs/2.0/clouds-LXD](./clouds-LXD.html)

  The controller is no longer your host machine; a LXD
  container is created instead. This keeps your host machine clean
  and allows you to utilize your local controler more like a Juju
  controller running in any other cloud. This also means you can test
  features like Juju’s  high-availability controllers without needing
  to use a cloud provider.


  ##### Setting up LXD on older series

  LXD has been made available in Trusty backports, but needs manual
  dependency resolution:

        sudo apt-get --target-release trusty-backports install lxd

  Before using a locally running LXD after installing it, either through
  Juju or the LXD CLI ("lxc"), you must either log out and back in or run
  this command:

        newgrp lxd

  See: [https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/)


  #### LXD Container Support

  Juju now uses LXD to provide containers when deploying applications. So
  instead of doing:

        juju deploy mysql --to lxc:1

  the new syntax is:

        juju deploy mysql --to lxd:1


  #### Microsoft Azure Resource Manager provider

  Juju now supports Microsoft Azure's new Resource Manager API. The new
  provider supports everything the old provider did, but now also
  supports several additional features, including unit placement,
  which allows you to specify existing machines to which units are
  deployed. As before, units of an application will be allocated to machines
  in a application-specific Availability Set if no machine is specified.

  To add credentials for Azure, run the command `juju add-credential azure`.
  Select the default interactive mode and you will be prompted to enter your
  subscription ID. You can find your subscription ID in the Azure portal
  ([https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) ).
  You will then be prompted to open a URL to authenticate with Azure,
  and authorise Juju to create credentials on your behalf.


  #### New support for the Rackspace Public Cloud

  A new provider has been added that supports hosting a Juju model in
  Rackspace Public Cloud. Add your credentials for Rackspace with:

        juju add-credential rackspace

  Then bootstrap:

        juju bootstrap rackspace


  #### OpenStack improvements

  ##### New OpenStack machines can be provisioned based on virtualization type (kvm, lxd)

  Openstack clouds with multi-hypervisor support have different images for
  LXD and KVM. Juju can now pick the right image for LXD or KVM instance
  based on the instance constraints:

        juju deploy mysql --constraints="virt-type=lxd,mem=8G,cpu=4"

  ##### Keystone 3 support in OpenStack

  Juju now supports Openstack with Keystone Identity provider V3. Keystone
  3 brings a new attribute to our credentials, "domain-name"
  (OS_DOMAIN_NAME) which is optional. If "domain-name" is present (and
  user/password too) juju will use V3 authentication by default. In other
  cases where only user and password is present, it will query OpenStack
  as to what identity providers are supported, and their endpoints. V3
  will be tried and, if it works, set as the identity provider otherwise it
  will use V2, the previous standard.

  #### Joyent provider no longer uses Manta storage

  The use of Joyent Manta Storage is no longer necessary and has been
  removed. The Manta credential attributes are not supported. `juju add-
  credential` will not prompt for them. Existing credential.yaml files used
  in previous betas will need to be edited to remove: manta-user, manta-
  key-id, manta-url


  ### Misc changes

  #### juju status improvements

  The default Juju status format is now tabular (not yaml). YAML can still
  be output by using the '--format yaml' arguments. The deprecated agent-
  state and associated yaml attributes are now deleted (these have been
  replaced since 1.24 by agent status and workload status attributes).

  The tabular status output now also includes relation information. This
  was previously only shown in the 'yaml' and 'json' output formats.


  ##### Machine provisioning status

  Juju status for machines has a new "machine-status" value in the yaml
  format. This reflects the state of the machine as it is being allocated
  within the cloud. For providers like MAAS, it is possible to see the
  state of the machine as it transitions from allocating to deploying to
  deployed. For containers it also provides extra information about the
  container being created.

        juju status --format yaml

          model: admin
          machines:
          "0":
            juju-status:
              current: allocating
              since: 24 Mar 2016 09:06:59+10:00
              version: 2.0-beta3.1
            dns-name: 10.0.1.92
            instance-id: juju-16db5c82-f7af-4b0a-8507-2023df01ce89-machine-0
            machine-status:
              current: allocating
              message: a2ef-dec1-8bfc-092e: deploying
              since: 24 Mar 2016 09:06:59+10:00
            series: trusty
            hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=0 mem=0M


  #### Juju client support for any Linux

  The Juju 2.0 client works on any Linux flavour. When bootstrapping
  with local tools, it is now possible to create a controller using
  any supported Linux series regardless of the Linux flavour the client
  is running on.


  #### Automatic retries of failed hooks

  Failing hooks are automatically retried with a backoff strategy.
  Backoff increases on each retry by a factor of 2 starting from 5
  seconds and is capped at 5 minutes. (5, 10, ..., 5\*60 seconds)

  A model configuration flag, `automatically-retry-hooks`, is now
  available that will toggle this behaviour. It affects all the units
  running in the same model. By default the flag is true and that
  is the recommended value for regular deployments.

  #### SSH host key checking

  The SSH host keys of Juju managed machines are now tracked and
  are verified by the juju ssh, scp and debug-hooks commands. This
  ensures that SSH connections established by these commands are
  actually made to the intended hosts.

  Host key checking can be disabled using the new --no-host-key-checks
  option for Juju’s SSH related commands. Routine use of this option
  is strongly discouraged.

  #### Juju logging improvements

  Logs from machine and unit agents are now streamed to controllers
  via API instead of using rsyslogd. This is a requirement of
  multi-model support, which is now enabled by default. Additionally,
  centralised logs are now stored in Juju's database instead of the a
  file. This improves log query flexibility and performance as well as
  opening up the possibility of structured log output in future
  Juju releases.

  The `juju debug-log` command will continue to function as before and
  should be used as the default way of accessing Juju's logs.


  ##### Juju log forwarding

  When enabled, log messages for all hosted models in a controller
  are forwarded to a syslog server over a secure TLS connection.
  The easiest way to configure the feature is to provide a
  config.yaml file at bootstrap:

        juju bootstrap <cloud>
            --config logforward-enabled=true --config logconfig.yaml

  The contents of the YAML file should currently be as follows:

        syslog-host: <host>:<port>
        syslog-ca-cert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         <cert-contents>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        syslog-client-cert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         <cert-contents>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        syslog-client-key: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
         <cert-contents>
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

  The feature can be toggled by setting the logforward-enabled
  attribute. When enabled, a maximum of 100 previous log lines
  will be forwarded.

  ##### Example syslog message

      <11>1 2016-02-28T09:57:10.804642398-05:00 172.12.3.1 juju - - [origin enterpriseId="28978" software="jujud" "2.0.0"] [model@28978 controller-uuid="deadbeef" model-uuid="deadbeef"] [log@28978 source-file="provider/ec2/storage.go" source-line="60"] Could not initialise machine block storage


  ### Audit logging

  In its initial implementation, audit logging is on by default.
  The audit log will be in /var/log/juju/audit.log for each controller
  machine. If running in an HA environment, the audit.log files on each
  controller machine must be collated to get a complete log. Future
  releases will provide a utility to merge the logs, akin to debug-log.

  Since users may interact with Juju from multiple sources (CLI, GUI,
  deployer, etc.), audit log entries record the API calls made, rather
  than only reporting CLI commands run. Only those API calls originating
  from authenticated users calling the external API are logged.


  #### Enhancements to `juju run`

  `juju run` now works by queueing actions using the name "juju-run".  
  The command line API has not changed.

  A few notes:

    * `juju run` is now supported on Windows. The commands are executed through PowerShell.
    * Any actions named `juju-run` defined in the charm will **not** work anymore. The charm build tool will forbid any actions starting with 'juju-' to be defined, similar to relations.
    * Because the commands are now actions, statistics related to queue times, execution times, etc. can be gathered.
    * The specified timeout is only taken into account when actually executing the action and does **not** account for delays that might come from the action waiting to be executed.
    * `show-action-status` also lists actions queued by `juju-run`.
    * To avoid flooding a new flag has been created for `show-action-status`.  You can now use `--name <action-name>` to only get the actions corresponding to a particular name.
    * `show-action-output` can be used to get more information on a
  particular command.


  #### API login with macaroons

  Juju 2.0 supports an alternate API login method based on macaroons.

  #### Experimental address-allocation feature flag is no longer supported

  In earlier releases, it was possible to have Juju use static IP
  addresses for containers from the same subnet as their host machine,
  using the following development feature flag:

      JUJU_DEV_FEATURE_FLAGS=address-allocation juju bootstrap ...

  This flag is no longer supported and will log a warning message if used.


  #### Mongo 3.2 support

  Juju now uses mongo 3.2 for its database with the new Wired Tiger
  storage engine enabled. This is initially only supported for 16.04 (Xenial).
  Trusty and Wily will be supported soon.


  ### Terminology

  "environments" are now be referred to as "models" and “services” are
  referred to as “applications”.  Commands which referenced "environments"
  or “services” now reference "models” or “applications” respectively.

  The "state-server" from Juju 1.x is now a "controller" in 2.0.


  ### Command name changes

  Juju commands have moved to a flat command structure instead of nested command structure:

  | 1.25 command                         | 2.0 command                   |
  |--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|

  |--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | juju system create-environment | juju add-model              |
  | juju system destroy            | juju destroy-controller     |
  | juju system environments       | juju models            |

  In general:

    * commands which list multiple things should start with `list-` and there
      will be an alias for the plural noun in the command, for
      example ‘list-controllers’ is an alias for ‘controllers’.
    * commands which look at an individual thing will start with `show-`.
    * commands which start with 'remove-' are used for things that can be easily recreated.
    * commands which start with 'destroy-' are used only for controllers and models.
