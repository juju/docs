^# juju-core 1.25.0

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.25.0, is now available.
  This release replaces version 1.24.7.


  ## Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.25.0 is available for Wily and backported to earlier
  series in the following PPA:

      https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable

  Windows Centos, and OS X users will find installers at:

      https://launchpad.net/juju-core/+milestone/1.25.0


  ## Notable Changes
    * (Experimental) Improved networking features for AWS
      * New 'spaces' and 'subnet' commands
      * New 'spaces' constraints support
    * Support for "devices" on MAAS 1.8+
    * Storage support for GCE and Azure providers
    * Payload management for charmers


  ### (Experimental) Improved networking features for AWS

  Juju has experimental support for deploying services on AWS in isolation,
  taking advantage of the enhanced AWS VPC networking features. This is just a
  first step towards a full-fledged networking model support in Juju.


  #### New 'spaces' and 'subnet' commands

  Juju introduces the 'space' and 'subnet' commands to manage the networks
  available to services. A Juju network space is a collection of related subnets
  that have no firewalls between each other and have the same ingress and egress
  policies.

  You can create a new Juju space, and optionally associate existing subnets
  with it by specifying their CIDRs using the 'create' subcommand. The command
  looks like this:

      juju space create <name> [<CIDR1> <CIDR2> …]

  The list of registered spaces can be seen using the 'list' subcommand:

      juju space list [--short] [--format yaml|json] [--output <path>]

  You can add an existing AWS subnet to a space by CIDR or AWS ID, for example:

      juju subnet add <CIDR>|<AWS-subnet-id> <space-name>

  You can list all the subnets known by Juju and optionally filtering them by
  space and/or availability zone like so:

      juju subnet list [--zone <name>] [--space <name>] [<zone1> <zone2> …]

  For more information about these commands, type:

      juju <command> --help


  #### New 'spaces' constraints support

  The new 'spaces' constraint instructs Juju to deploy a service's units in
  subnets of the given space.

  Similar to the 'tags' constraint, the 'spaces' constraint takes a comma-
  delimited list of existing Juju network spaces. Both positive (without prefix)
  and negative (prefixed by "^") spaces are allowed in the list. For this alpha
  release, the first positive space name is used, the rest is ignored.

  You can constrain a service to a space like this:

      juju deploy <charm-URL> [<service-name>] [--constraints "spaces=<list>"]

  For more information, run

      juju help glossary

  and

      juju help constraints


  #### Known issues

  Deploying a service to a space that has no subnets will cause the agent to
  panic and is a known issue (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1499426). This issue
  can be mitigated by always adding at least one subnet to the space.


  ### Support "devices" on MAAS 1.8+

  MAAS 1.8 introduced a new feature called "devices". This allows the
  association of a "device", that requires an IP address, with a parent machine
  managed by MAAS. There is a view in the MAAS UI showing all devices.


  ### Storage support for GCE and Azure providers

  Juju's storage feature can now be used with the Google Compute Engine and
  Azure providers. Storage is now supported for local, AWS, Openstack, MAAS, GCE
  and Azure. See https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/storage for more information.


  ### Status for storage volumes

  Volumes now have status associated, so provisioning progress can be observed.
  List the volumes to see their status:

      juju storage volume list


  ### Payload management for charmers

  The new payload management feature allows charmers to more accurately define
  large and complex deployments by registering different payloads, such as LXC,
  KVM, and docker, with Juju. This lets the operator better understand the
  purpose and function of these payloads on a given machine.

  You define these payloads in the metadata.yaml of the charm under the
  payloads section. You create a class for the payload, "monitoring" or "kvm-
  guest", and assign the type.

      payloads:
          monitoring:
              type: docker
          kvm-guest:
              type: kvm

  From your charm hook you can manage your payload with the following
  commands:

      payload-register <type> <class> <ID> [tags]
      payload-unregister <type> <class> <ID>
      payload-status-set <type> <class> <ID> <starting, running, stopping, stopped>

  From the Juju command line you can view your payloads like this:

        juju list-payloads <filter>

  For more information run:

      juju help payloads

^# juju-core 1.24.7

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.24.7, is now available.
  This release replaces version 1.24.6.


  ## Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.24.7 is available for Wily and backported to earlier
  series in the following PPA:

     https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable

  Windows, Centos7, and OS X users will find installers at:

     https://launchpad.net/juju-core/+milestone/1.24.7


  ## Notable Changes

  ### The default EC2 instance is m3.medium

  AWS deprecated the m1.* instance type. Juju now uses the m3.medium as
  the default instance type when provisioning machines in EC2.

   * m1.* instances will only be selected when specified using the
     "instance-type" constraint.

   * When no constraints are specified, the m3.medium type will be selected.

   * When constraints are specified, m1 instance types which satisfy
     the constraints will be ignored.


  ### Use the "storage" feature flag to try charms that support storage.

  Storage was classified as experimental in 1.24, and has been found to be
  problematic. Since storage is used implicitly by charms with default
  stores, the feature was placed behind a feature flag. You can test
  charms that support storage by bootstrapping a new environment with
  "storage" enabled like so:

     JUJU_DEV_FEATURE_FLAG=storage juju bootstrap

     Lp 1500613

   * Config-changed error does not cause error state
     Lp 1494542

     Lp 1497094

   * Failed worker can result in large number of goroutines and open
     socket connections and eventually gets picked on by the oom killer
     Lp 1496750

   * Upgrade in progress reported, but panic happening behind scenes
     Lp 1493123

   * juju occasionally switches a units public-address if an additional
     interface is added post-deployment
     Lp 1435283

  ### VMWare (vSphere) Provider

  Juju now supports VMWare's vSphere ("Software-Defined Data Center")
  installations as a targetable cloud. It uses the vSphere API to interact
  with the vCenter server. The vSphere provider uses the OVA images
  provided by Ubuntu's official repository. API authentication
  credentials, as well as other config options, must be added to your
  environments.yaml file before running 'juju bootstrap'. The different
  options are described below.

  The basic config options in your environments.yaml will look like this:

      my-vsphere:
        type: vsphere
        host: <192.168.1.10>
        user: <some-user>
        password: <some-password>
        datacenter: <datacenter-name>
        external-network: <external-network-name>

  The values in angle brackets need to be replaced with your vSphere
  information. 'host' must contain the IP address or DNS name of vSphere
  API endpoint. 'user' and 'password' are fields that must contain your
  vSphere user credentials. 'datacenter' field must contain the name of
  your vSphere virtual datacenter. 'external-network' is an optional
  field. If set, it must contain name of the network that will be used to
  obtain public IP addresses for each virtual machine provisioned by juju.
  An IP pool must be configured in this network and all available public
  IP addresses must be added to this pool. For more information on IP
  pools, see official documentation:

      https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc%2FGUID-5B3AF10D-8E4A-403C-B6D1-91D9171A3371.html

  NOTE that using the vSphere provider requires an existing vSphere
  installation. Juju does not set up vSphere for you. The OVA images we
  use support VMWare's Hardware Version 8 (or newer). This should not be a
  problem for most vSphere installations.


  ### Resource Tagging (EC2, OpenStack)

  Juju now tags instances and volumes created by the EC2 and OpenStack
  providers with the Juju environment UUID. Juju also adds any user-
  specified tags set via the "resource-tags" environment setting. The
  format of this setting is a space-separated list of key=value pairs:

      resource-tags: key1=value1 [key2=value2 ...]

  These tags may be used, for example, to set up chargeback accounting.
  Any tags that Juju manages will be prefixed with "juju-"; users must
  avoid modifying these.

  Instances and volumes are now named consistently across EC2 and
  OpenStack, using the scheme "juju-<env>-<resource-type>-<resource-
  ID>", where <env> is the human-readable name of the environment as
  specified in environments.yaml; <resource-type> is the type of the
  resource ("machine" or "volume") and <resource-ID> is the numeric ID
  of the Juju machine or volume corresponding to the IaaS resource.


  ### MAAS root-disk Constraint

  The MAAS provider now honours the root-disk constraint, if the targeted
  MAAS supports disk constraints. Support for disk constraints was added
  to MAAS 1.8.


  ### Service Status

  Juju provides new hooks for charm authors to report service status, and
  'juju status' now includes the service status. This new functionality
  allows charms to explicitly inform Juju of their status, rather than
  Juju guessing. Charm authors have access to 2 new hook tools, and the
  status report includes more information.

  The 'status-set' hook tool allows a charm to report its status to Juju.
  This is known as the workload status and is meant to reflect the state
  of the software deployed by the charm. Charm authors are responsible for
  setting the workload's status to "Active" when the charm is ready to run
  its workload, and "Blocked" when it needs user intervention to resolve a
  problem.

      status-set:
          status-set <maintenance | blocked | waiting | active> "message"

  The 'status-get' hook tool allows a charm to query the current workload
  status recorded in Juju. Without arguments, it just prints the workload
  status value eg maintenance. With '--include-data' specified, it prints
  YAML which contains the status value plus any data associated with the
  status.

      status-get:
          status-get [--include-data]

  Charms that do not make use of these hook tools will still work as
  before, but Juju will not provide details about the workload status.

  The above commands set the status of the individual units. Unit
  leaders may also set and get the status of the service to which they
  belong:

  print the status of all units of the service and the service itself:
  status-get --service

  set the status of the service:
  status-set --service <maintenance | blocked | waiting | active> "message" 

  The 'juju status' command includes the 'workload-status' and
  'service-status' in the report. for example:

      services:
       ...
        wordpress:
          charm: local:trusty/wordpress-93
          exposed: false
          service-status:                    <-- new service status
            current: blocked
            message: Waiting for database
            since: 01 May 2015 17:39:38 AEST
          relations:
            loadbalancer:
            - wordpress
          units:
            wordpress/0:
              workload-status:                <-- new workload status
                current: blocked
                message: Waiting for database
                since: 01 May 2015 17:39:38 AEST
              agent-status:                   <-- new agent status
                current: idle
                since: 01 May 2015 17:39:44 AEST
                version: 1.24-alpha1.1
              agent-state: started            <-- legacy Juju agent state
              agent-version: 1.24-alpha1.1
              machine: "1"
              open-ports:
              - 80/tcp
              public-address: 23.20.250.14

  Juju aggregates all the unit 'workload-status' values to represent the
  'service-status'. The 'service-status' value is derived from the worst
  case status of all the units; eg. if any unit is in error, then the
  service is in error.

  The 'status' command will use a table layout in the future, and you can
  set the environmental variable 'JUJU_CLI_VERSION' to "2" to see it like
  so:

      export JUJU_CLI_VERSION=2
      juju status

      NAME       STATUS  EXPOSED CHARM                      
      mysql      unknown false   local:trusty/mysql-326     
      wordpress  blocked false   local:trusty/wordpress-93  

  The legacy status values are omitted from output. You can use the
  '--yaml' option to see status in the Juju 1.x layout.

  Juju also records a history of status changes for a unit, and tracks the
  time when the status was last updated. The 'juju status-history' command
  allows you to inspect a charm's status changes over time

      juju status-history [options] [-n N] <unit>

      options:
      -e, --environment (= "")
         juju environment to operate in
      -n  (= 20)
         size of logs backlog.
      --type (= "combined")
         type of statuses to be displayed [agent|workload|combined].
      --utc  (= false)
         display time as UTC in RFC3339 format

      This command will report the history of status changes for
      a given unit.
      The statuses for the unit workload and/or agent are available.
      -type supports:
         agent: will show statuses for the unit's agent
         workload: will show statuses for the unit's workload
         combined: will show agent and workload statuses combined
      and sorted by time of occurrence.

  For example, to see the history of the unit wordpress/0

      juju status-history wordpress/0

      TIME                       TYPE     STATUS       MESSAGE

  ### CentOS 7 Preview

  Juju 1.24.0 has initial CentOS support. This is experimental and has a
  number of known issues. However, most of the functionality of Juju
  should be there and ready to be used and tested. CentOS should be
  deployable on any cloud that supports cloud-init in it's CentOS
  images. It is possible to use CentOS as both a state machine (taking
  the limitations at the bottom into account) and as a normal machine.

  Deploying a charm on CentOS is no different than deploying one on
  Ubuntu or Windows. The only thing that needs to change is the series
  which is "centos7". For example, from Launchpad:

      juju deploy lp:~me/centos7/charm

  or Locally:

      juju deploy --repository=/home/user/charms local:centos7/charm

  However there are no charms currently available for CentOS. The
  process or writing one should be no different from the Ubuntu charms
  besides keeping in mind the fact that one shouldn't use Ubuntu
  specific calls (such as apt).

  There is a guide for setting up a MaaS environment using CentOS at

      http://wiki.cloudbase.it/juju-centos


  Note that Centos 7 agents are already in streams. There is no need
  install Go, compile, tar, and running juju metadata. You can sync the
  streams to a web server visible to your Juju environment.

      mkdir local
      juju sync-tools --local-dir local
      cp -r local/tools <path/to/webserver>


  Some of the known issues are:

    * Containers are not yet supported

    * There is a lack of mongo tools at the moment so any functionality
      depending on those is not available(for example backups)

    * There is no way to currently specify a proxy or mirror for yum in
      the environment configuration. The values that you specific for apt
      packages will be used for yum packages as well. This limitation
      will be fixed as soon as possible.


  ### Storage (experimental)

  Juju now models storage, charms can request storage (volumes and
  filesystems), and you can specify constraints on how to satisfy those
  requests (which provider, what options, how large, how many).

  Initially, Juju supports native volumes for the EC2 (EBS) and
  OpenStack (Cinder), and MAAS providers. Juju also supports several
  cloud-independent storage providers: tmpfs, loop (loop devices), root
  filesystem. Future versions of Juju will extend this set with
  providers for Ceph, NFS, and others.

  The storage feature is experimental: it has some known caveats, and has
  not yet been battle hardened. Instructions on use and caveats are
  documented at https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/wip-storage.


  ### Storage (experimental) MAAS Provider Support

  The MAAS provider now supports storage. Storage directives are used to
  select machines which have the requisite number and size of volumes
  available on the machine (usually physical volumes such as SSD or
  magnetic drives).

  Storage pools may be created to select volumes with specified tags.

      juju storage create pool maas-ssd maas tags=ssd

  The above creates a pool called "maas-ssd" and when used, will select
  volumes tagged in MAAS with the "ssd" tag. Tags may be a comma separated
  list.

  Then to deploy a charm:

      juju deploy mycharm --storage data=maas-ssd,50G

  The above deploys a charm to a MAAS machine with the data store mounted
  on a volume at least 50GiB in size with the tag "ssd".

  It is also possible to specify the size of the root-disk using the root
  disk constraint. This works the same way as for the AWS provider

      juju deploy mysql --constraints root-disk=50G

  Storage directives and root disk constraints may be combined.

      juju deploy mysql --constraints root-disk=50G --storage data=maas-ssd,500G

  NOTE: the root disk support has only just landed in MAAS trunk.
  the Juju/MAAS storage support has been smoke tested using the NEC
  MAAS test lab. It needs much more extensive testing!

  NOTE: when using MAAS which does not support storage, if MAAS storage is
  requested, an error is returned and the node is cleaned up.

  The storage feature is experimental: it has some known caveats, and has
  not yet been battle hardened. Instructions on use and caveats are
  documented at https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/wip-storage.


  ### Storage (experimental) Unit Placement

  It is now possible to deploy units with storage to existing machines.
  This applies when using storage that is dynamically created, such as
  EBS/Cinder volumes, loop devices, TMPFS, rootfs. It can't be used with
  machine volumes on MAAS, but can be used to deploy charms to an existing
  MAAS machine if a dynamic storage source is specified. eg.

      juju deploy charm --to 2 --storage data=loop,2G

  An Openstack deployment example:

      juju deploy charm --to 2 --storage data=cinder,2G

  ### New Support for Google Compute Engine (GCE)

  A new provider has been added that supports hosting a Juju environment
  in GCE. This feature leverages the support for Ubuntu cloud-images that
  GCE added late 2014. It uses Google's GCE API to interact with your
  account there. API authentication credentials, as well as other config
  options, must be added to your environments.yaml file before running
  'juju bootstrap'. The different options are described below.

  The basic config options in your environments.yaml will look like this:

  ```yaml
  my-gce:
   type: gce
   project-id: <your-project-id>
   auth-file: <path-to-json-file-from-google>
   private-key: <your-private-key>
   client-email: <your-client-email>
   client-id: <your-client-id>
  ```

  The values in angle brackets need to be replaced with your GCE
  information.

  'project-id' must identify a GCE project that already exists before you
  run "juju bootstrap".  This means creating a new one through the
  developer console (https://console.developers.google.com/project) before
  bootstrapping Juju.  To make it easier to quickly identify in your GCE
  console, we recommend that the name start with 'juju-' and that it
  include the environment name you are planning to use.  You could also
  use an existing project but we recommend against that if possible.
  Using a new project will make it easier for you to manage the
  environment's resources as well as to track the environment's cost and
  resource usage.

  'auth-file' is the path to a JSON file you get from your GCE console
  that contains all the authentication credentials it needs.  After you
  have created your project, download the file by pressing the
  'Generate new JSON key' button in the 'Service Account' section of

  https://console.developers.google.com/project/<project-id>/apiui/credential

  If necessary, instead of 'auth-file' you may set the 'private-key',
  'client-email', and 'client-id' fields in your environments.yaml.  They
  are your GCE OAuth credentials (matching those in the JSON file).  You
  may need to change "\u003d" in the private key to "=".

  Either way, these details are associated with the 'service account' of
  the GCE project you will use for your Juju environment.  For each GCE
  project, a service account is set up automatically when you create the
  project.  Juju uses that service account to connect to the GCE API and
  does so with the proper authentication scope.

  For more information please refer to
  
  https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount
  
  and
  
  https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#serviceaccount
  

  If the project's service account has any permissions problems go to the
  following page to fix them:

  https://console.developers.google.com/project/<project-id>/permissions
  
  (remember to insert the *project id*)

  The GCE API should already be activated for the project. It it isn't,
  go to the following URL in your console:
 
  https://console.developers.google.com/project/<project-name>/apiui/api

  (insert the *project name*)

  Also see step 2 on
  
  https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/api/how-tos/authorization.

  The following config options in your environments.yaml file are
  optional:

      region - (default us-central1) The location to place the
             environment.
      image-endpoint - (default https://www.googleapis.com) This is
             where Juju will look for disk images when provisioning a
             new instance on GCE.

  All Juju 1.23 provider capabilities are available for GCE except for
  networking.


  ### Support for systemd (and Vivid)

  In addition to upstart, Juju now supports Ubuntu hosts using systemd as
  their init system.

  Support for systemd allows Juju to run on Ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet),
  which is the first Ubuntu release to boot with systemd. This means you
  can bootstrap Juju on a Vivid host. Note that the charm store
  (jujucharms.com) only support LTS releases. You can develop and test
  vivid charms in a local charm repository.


  ### New Style Restore

  You can now restore a backup with the new 'backups restore' command,
  which is more reliable and fast. New restore supports backups generated
  with the deprecated Juju backup plugin and with the recently added 'juju
  backups create' command. You can restore from a local backup file like
  so:

  ```bash
  juju backups restore [-b] --file <backup file>
  ```

  Which will optionally bootstrap a new state server, upload a backup file
  and restore it. The -b option will fail if there is a running state
  server.

  You can also restore from a backup stored on the state-server:

  ```bash
  juju backups restore --id <on server backup id>
  ```

  To obtain a list of the existing backups in the state-server you can
  use:

  ```bash
  juju backups list
  ```


  ### Improved Proxy Support for Restrictive Networks

  A few of issues around HTTP/HTTPS and apt proxy support were fixed (Lp
  1403225, Lp 1417617). Charm downloads from the charm store which could
  not be completed due to connectivity issues are now retried every few
  minutes rather than once every 24 hours. Proxy settings from the
  environment (http-proxy, https-proxy, ftp-proxy, apt-http-proxy,
  apt-https-proxy, apt-ftp-proxy, and no-proxy) are properly propagated to
  all machines, and Juju agents use them for all external connectivity.
  The juju run command also uses proxy settings when defined, as well as
  debug-hooks and all hooks the a charm runs. You can specify one or more
  proxy settings via environment variables (http_proxy, https_proxy, etc.)
  or inside your environments.yaml. Other related proxies are configured
  as needed (e.g. you can specify just http-proxy, and that will also be
  used for https, ftp, and apt proxies).


  ### New Charm Actions

  Juju charms can describe actions that users can take on deployed
  services. These actions are scripts that can be triggered on a unit by
  the via the Juju CLI (support for triggering actions from the Juju GUI
  will follow soon). Schemas for each action are defined in an
  actions.yaml file in the charm root, and conform to JSON-Schema. When an
  action is invoked, passed parameters are validated against the
  respective schema as explained in "Actions for the Charm author" at both
  the API and the unit level:

  https://jujucharms.com/docs/1.20/authors-charm-actions
  

  CLI Actions are sub-commands of the 'juju action' command. For more
  details on their usage, 'juju action help' has examples and further
  material.

  The following subcommands are currently specified:

    * defined - show actions defined for a service
    * do - queue an action for execution
    * fetch - show results of an action by ID
    * status - show results of actions filtered by optional ID prefix


  ### New Blocks and Messages

  You can now specify block message when you enable a block. For example,
  you can add a message to 'destroy-environment':

  ```bash
  juju block destroy-environment "Don't destroy this environment"
  juju destroy-environment
  ERROR Don't destroy this environment
  ```

  You can list the blocks enabled in the environment like so:

  ```no-highlight
  juju block list
  destroy-environment=on, Don't destroy this environment
  remove-object=off
  all-changes=off
  ```

  The Multiwatcher now has information about blocks. There is now block
  client capable of switching blocks on/off as well as listing all enabled
  blocks.


  ### Experimental: Service Leader Elections

  Services can now coordinate leadership among the deployed units using
  Juju's service leader election support.

  Charms now have access to three new hook tools:

  ```no-highlight
  is-leader - returns true only if the executing unit is guaranteed
    service leadership for the next 30s
  leader-get - as relation-get; accessible only within the service
  leader-set - as relation-set; will fail if not executed on leader
  ```

  ...and two new hooks:

  ```no-highlight
  leader-elected - runs when the unit takes service leadership
  leader-settings-changed - runs when another unit runs leader-set
  ```

  When a unit starts up, it will always run either leader-elected or
  leader-settings-changed as soon as possible, delaying only doing so only
  to run the install hook; complete any queued or in-flight operation; or
  resolve a hook or upgrade error.
   
  Known limitations: 

    * Amazon limits the number of addresses the containers an instance can
      have based on its size. 
    * Statically allocated addresses are not released on container shutdown. 
    * Container addressability does not survive a host reboot. 
    * No public IP address is added on AWS, and we don’t yet support
      dynamic port mapping -- so you can not yet expose containerized
      services on Amazon.

  ## Notable Changes

  This releases addresses stability and performance issues.
  
  
  ### Vivid local-provider limitations
  
  Juju 1.22.x on Vivid is suitable for creating and maintaining Juju
  environments in public and private clouds, including MAAS.
  Local-provider support for Vivid's default systemd installation will
  land in 1.23. To use Juju 1.22 on Vivid for local testing and charm
  development you must take some additional steps.

  You can switch back to upstart, as explained at:

  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers

  Alternatively you can run Ubuntu Trusty inside a KVM or Docker running
  on your localhost. Many charm authors prefer to use Vagrant for
  development to separate the Juju from their localhost. We provide Juju
  Vagrant boxes:

  https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/config-vagrant

  The Juju (1.23.x) will support systemd on Vivid. You can test and
  develop using the local-provider. 1.23.x will first be available via
  the official stable PPA:

  https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable

  And will appear in the release shortly thereafter.

  ## Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.22.0 is available for utopic and backported to earlier
  series in the following PPA:

  https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable

  Windows and OS X users will find installers at:

  https://launchpad.net/juju-core/+milestone/1.22.0


  ## Notable Changes

    * Blocking changes to the environment
    * LXC image caching and the cached-images command
    * Juju state backup improvements
    * Static internal route for Joyent instances
    * The instance availability zone is exposed to charms
    * Relaxed checked for container scoped relations
    * Windows workloads preview

    * Upgrade robustness
    * Multi-environment infrastructure


  ### Blocking changes to the environment

  The 'block' and 'unblock' commands control which changes can be made to
  a running environment. Use the 'block' command to lockdown the
  environment to prevent accidental changes. Three levels of restrictions
  can be applied, 'destroy-environment', 'remove-object', and
  'all-changes'.

  The 'destroy-environment' level blocks just the 'destroy-environment'
  command. You can prevent an environment from being destroyed like this:

  ```bash
  juju block destroy-environment
  ```

  The 'remove-object' level blocks the 'destroy-environment',
  'remove-machine', 'remove-relation', 'remove-service', and 'remove-unit'
  commands from being run. You can prevent the machines, services, units
  and relations from being removed thusly:

  ```bash
  juju block remove-object
  ```

  The 'all-changes' level blocks commands that add, alter, or remove
  things in the running environment. These commands are blocked:
  'add-machine', 'add-relation', 'add-unit', 'authorised-keys add',
  'authorised-keys delete', 'authorised-keys import', 'deploy',
  'destroy-environment', 'ensure-availability', 'expose', 'resolved',
  'remove-machine', 'remove-relation', 'remove-service', 'remove-unit',
  'retry-provisioning', 'run', 'set', 'set-constraints', 'set-env',
  'unexpose', 'unset', 'unset-env', 'upgrade-charm', 'upgrade-juju',
  'user add', 'user change-password', 'user disable', and 'user enable'
  You can lockdown the environment to prevent all changes like this:

  ```bash
  juju block all-changes
  ```

  When a command is blocked, and you are certain you need to alter the
  environment, you can remove the block using the 'unblock' command. For
  example, to permit the remove-relation command blocked by the
  'remove-object' level, run:

  ```bash
  juju unblock remove-object
  ```

  You can restore the block after you complete your changes.

  Note that some commands have a '--force' option bypasses the
  restrictions set by 'block'. Only use the '--force' option *after* the
  command was run without it to ensure you are aware of the restrictions
  set on the environment by the 'block' command.

  For more information run 'juju help block' and 'juju help unblock'.


  ### LXC image caching and the cached-images command

  From Juju 1.22 onwards, LXC images are cached in the Juju environment
  when they are retrieved to instantiate a new LXC container. This applies
  to the local provider and all other cloud providers. This caching is
  done independently of whether image cloning is enabled.

  Note: Due to current upgrade limitations, image caching is currently not
  available for machines upgraded to 1.22. Only machines deployed with
  1.22 will cache the images.

  In Juju 1.22, lxc-create is configured to fetch images from the Juju
  state server. If no image is available, the state server will fetch the
  image from http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com and then cache it. This means
  that the retrieval of images from the external site is only done once
  per *environment*, not once per new machine which is the default
  behaviour of lxc. The next time lxc-create needs to fetch an image, it
  comes directly from the Juju environment cache.

  The 'cached-images' command can list and delete cached LXC images stored
  in the Juju environment. The 'list' and 'delete' subcommands support
  '--arch' and '--series' options to filter the result.

  To see all cached images, run:

  ```bash
  juju cached-images list
  ```

  Or to see just the amd64 trusty images run:

  ```bash
  juju cached-images list --series trusty --arch amd64
  ```

  To delete the amd64 trusty cached images run:

  ```bash
  juju cache-images delete --series trusty --arch amd64
  ```

  Future development work will allow Juju to automatically download new
  LXC images when they becomes available, but for now, the only way update
  a cached image is to remove the old one from the Juju environment. Juju
  will also support KVM image caching in the future.

  See 'juju cached-images list --help' and 'juju cached-images delete
  --help' for more details.


  ### Juju state backup improvements

  The backup CLI plugin is replaced by the native 'backups' command. The
  command can create, manage, and restore state backups. The new backup
  features are also available using the API endpoints too.

  You can create a backup like this:

  ```bash
  juju backups create
  ```

  Backups are kept on the state-server by default, but you can use the
  'download' and 'upload' subcommands to move backups between locations.

  ```bash
  juju backups download <id>
  juju backups upload <filename>
  ```

  You can list the backups and see info about a specific backup using
  these subcommands:

  ```bash
  juju backups list
  juju backups info <id>
  ```

  You can remove unwanted backups like this:

  ```bash
  juju backups remove <id>
  ```

  The juju 'restore' command is unchanged. You can learn more about
  backups by reading the details of 'juju help backups'.


  ### The instance availability zone is exposed to charms

  Charms can query the 'JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE' environmental variable to
  learn the instance's availability zone. Not all clouds/providers support
  availability zones, but this information is available when the charm is
  deployed in EC2 and HP Cloud for example.


  ### Relaxed checked for container scoped relations

  Container scoped relations are now allowed as long a there is at least
  one subordinate service involved. Previously there had to be exactly one
  subordinate service in the relation.


  ### Static internal route for Joyent instances

  When running in Joyent, Juju creates a static route to ensure that it is
  always possible for instance to communicate over the internal network
  interface.


  ### Windows workloads preview

  Juju 1.22.0 has initial Windows workload support. This is BETA, and will
  be improved in the following releases.

  Deploying Windows charms is just the same as it is for Ubuntu:

  ```bash
  juju deploy lp:~me/win2012r2/my-charm
  ```

  or from a local repository

  ```bash
  juju deploy --repository=/home/me/charms local:win2012r2/my-charm
  ```

  A Juju charm boilerplate is available:

      https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-charms-boilerplate

  Powershell is the language of choice when writing Juju charms for
  Windows, as it is tightly coupled to Windows automation. You may use any
  language you see fit.

  There are a few notable differences between charms running on Ubuntu and
  charms running on Windows:

    * All charm hooks must have one of the following extensions: .ps1,
      .cmd, .bat, .exe. The extensions will be searched in order, with
      powershell being default.
    * All juju files/charms are located in: C:\juju . The folder
      structure should be the same as on ubuntu, with C:\juju as the root.
    * Cloudbase-init installs a local copy of python 2.7 (soon to switch
      to 3.X). If you wish, you can write python code to deploy your
      applications, but keep in mind you would have to wrap the execution
      of your script with one of the supported filetypes (.ps1, .cmd,
      .bat, .exe).
    * If the machine reboots, Juju machine agents and unit agents will
      have a delayed start. This means that Juju services
      will start 2 minutes after the last Windows service is started. So
      if the Juju services are listed as "Stopped" immediately after
      reboot, don't panic.
    * All Juju services (and therefor charms) will run under an
      administrator account called: jujud. This will allow charms to use
      installers that require a real user, and not just the "system" user.

  Juju requires Windows images with cloudbase-init to deploy Juju
  services. For public clouds which run KVM/Hyper-V and have one of the
  supported metadata services in cloudbase-init, there is a downloadable:

      http://www.cloudbase.it/ws2012r2/

  You need to upload custom images. So roughly, the steps would be:

    1. Download image from http://www.cloudbase.it/ws2012r2/
    2. Add it to your cloud provider
    3. Generate necessary metadata using
       juju-metadata generate-image -s win2012r2 -i <image id from provider>
    4. Make the generated files available. A simple webserver or simply
       uploading the files to the provider's object storage should do. As
       long as they are accessible to the newly booted up instances.
    5. Change agent-metadata-url in environments.yaml to point to the "tools"
       directory that 'generate-image' created.
    6. Bootstrap your environment

  If you want to use other Windows version in your cloud, or if you need
  image formats other then vhdx or qcow2, you can generate your own image
  using the following tools:

      https://github.com/cloudbase/windows-openstack-imaging-tools

  Current Windows limitations:

    * Windows cannot be used as a bootstrap machine for the state-server.
      Only machine agents are supported.
    * 'juju ssh' currently does not work with Windows. The implementation
      is tightly coupled with *nix systems, and having OpenSSH deployed on
      Windows machines might later become a security risk due to the fact
      that it is not part of normal Windows update systems. Work is being
      done to integrate WinRM support into Juju. This will allow us to
      offer the same level of integration using powershell remoting
      (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd357801.aspx)
    * Manual provider is not supported. Manual provider requires SSH to
      deploy. See above mention.
    * Local provider is not supported. Local provider relies on LXC
      or KVM and it deploys a state-server to the host, which is
      not supported on Windows.
    * Debug hooks are not yet supported yet. The current implementation
      requires SSH and tmux to work, which is very platform specific. This
      will be implemented for Windows soon.


  ### New annotations client includes charms and bulk calls

  The new api.annotations.client supports annotating charms, the
  environment, machines, services, and units. It supports bulk calls. The
  old api.client annotation functions are deprecated.

  The SET annotations call takes this form:

  ```json
  {
      "Type": "Annotations",
      "Request": "Set",
      "Params": {
	   "Annotations": { {
	       "EntityTag": a, "Annotations": pairs1
	       },{
	       "EntityTag": b, "Annotations": pairs2
	   } }
  }
  ```

  The corresponding GET annotations call takes this form:

  ```json
  {
      "Type": "Annotations",
      "Request": "Get",
      "Params": {
	 "Entities": {
	     {Entity {"Tag": a}},
	     {Entity {"Tag": b},
	 }
      }
  }
  ```

  The GET response looks like this:

  ```json
  {
      "Results": {
	  {"EntityTag": a, "Annotations": pairs1, "Error": nil},
	  {"EntityTag": b, "Annotations": pairs2, "Error": nil},
      }
  }
  ```


  ### Juju upgrade robustness

  During Juju upgrades (the 'upgrade-juju' command), steps specific to
  Juju state-servers are now run before other upgrade steps. Database
  migrations on the state-server are completed before machine updates and
  updates of the Juju agents on deployed units.


  ### Multi-environment infrastructure

  Juju will soon be able to support multiple environments managed by a
  single state server (or state server cluster). Although this is not yet
  visible, version 1.22 includes much of the infrastructure changes for
  multi-environment support.

  ### Selecting provisioner harvest modes

  Juju keeps a model of what it thinks the environment looks like, and
  based on that model, can harvest machines which it deems are no longer
  required. This can help keep your costs low, and keep you out of web
  consoles. Juju supports several harvesting modes to suit your needs.

  _Destroyed:_ Juju will harvest only machine instances that are marked as
  dead, and that Juju knows about. Running instances unknown to Juju will
  not be harvested. This is the default mode.

  _Unknown:_ Juju will harvest only instances that Juju does not know about.

  _All:_ Juju will terminate all instances – destroyed or unknown – that it
  finds. This is a good option if you are only utilizing Juju for your
  environment.

  _None:_ Juju won't harvest any machines. This is the most conservative
  mode, and a good choice if you manage your machines utilizing a separate
  process outside of Juju.

  Juju's harvesting behaviour is set through the environments.yaml file.

  ```yaml
  provisioner-harvest-mode: <MODE>
  ```

  ```provisioner-harvest-mode``` replaces ```safe-mode```. Environments with
  ```safe-mode``` set will be converted to ```provisioner-harvest-mode``` when
  upgraded.


  ### Using apt mirrors

  You can now configure ```apt-mirror``` in environments.yaml to specify the
  mirror used by all the machines provisioned in the environment:

      apt-mirror: http://my.archive.ubuntu.com

  On precise, the cloud tools archive is now pinned before calling apt
  upgrade to ensure its packages are a lower priority than the default
  precise archives. Charms developed on precise will see the same packages
  when deployed into a Juju provisioned machine. If your precise charm
  requires packages from the cloud tool's archive, you can use the
  ```target-release``` option to specify the archive to select:

  ```bash
  apt-get --target-release precise-updates/cloud-tools my-package
  ```


  ### Configuring OS update and upgrade for faster provisioning

  When Juju provisions a machine, its default behaviour is to update the
  list of available packages and upgrade the existing packages to the
  latest version. If your OS images are fresh or the services you deploy
  do not require updated packages, you can disable updates and upgrades to
  provision the machine faster.

  Two configuration options are available to disable apt updates and
  upgrades. When your OS images are fresh, you can set both
  ```enable-os-refresh-update```, and ```enable-os-upgrade``` to false. When you
  know that some charms want the latest packages to set up services,
  you will want to keep ```enable-os-refresh-update``` set to "true".

  You can configure the options in environments.yaml for fast provisioning
  like so:

  ```yaml
  enable-os-upgrade: false
  enable-os-refresh-update: false
  ```
  The local provider skips apt upgrades by default for faster
  provisioning. If you wish to enable upgrades in your local
  development, set ```enable-os-upgrade``` to
  "true" in your environments.yaml:

  ```yaml
  enable-os-upgrade: true
  ```

  If you are using the local-provider to develop charms or test, you
  will want to regularly purge the Juju template and LXC caches to
  be certain you are using fresh images. For example, before you start
  testing a new trusty charm, you can remove the template and cloud
  image like this:

  ```bash
  sudo lxc-destroy -n juju-trusty-lxc-template
  sudo rm -r /var/cache/lxc/cloud-trusty
  ```


  ### Using daily image streams for faster provisioning

  Juju prefers to use the slow-changing "released" images when
  provisioning machines. The ```image-stream``` option in environments.yaml
  can be set to "daily" use more up-to-date images, thus shortening the
  time it takes to perform apt-get update/upgrade. While this feature has
  existed since 1.18.0, it was not applied consistently to KVM containers.
  KVM containers will now use "daily" when environments.yaml is set to:

  ```yaml
  image-stream: daily
  ```

  ### Selecting the agent stream to get alternate version of Juju

  The ```agent-stream``` config option selects the versions of Juju that
  an environment can deploy and upgrade to. The default behaviour
  of Juju is to select agents from the "released" stream. These are
  the most stable versions of Juju. You can set ```agent-stream``` to
  select "devel" streams now to test the unstable versions of Juju:

  ```yaml
  agent-stream: devel
  ```

  You can evaluate the next stable version of Juju before it is the default
  version by selecting the "proposed" stream like this:

  ```yaml
  agent-stream: proposed
  ```

  The ```tools-metadata-url``` was renamed to ```agent-metadata-url``` and it does
  not need to be set to get "devel" or "proposed". You can remove it from
  environments.yaml if you have set it. ```agent-metadata-url``` is
  only needed to select a private stream.

  If you have an existing test environment using ```tools-metadata-url``` or
  ```agent-metadata-url``` to test proposed versions, you can still upgrade to
  1.21.0. After you upgrade, you can update the environment to use the
  devel streams at the default stream location:

  ```bash
  juju unset-env agent-metadata-url
  juju set-env agent-stream=proposed
  ```

  Subsequent upgrades will "just work".


  ### Tuning Juju to take advantage of NUMA

  Juju can be tuned to take advantage of NUMA machines. If your
  state-server will be on a machine with NUMA support, you can set
  ```set-numa-control-policy``` to true in environments.yaml like this:

  ```yaml
  set-numa-control-policy: true
  ```

  The default value is false.


  ### Configuring the MAAS network rules

  Juju and MAAS cannot both be in control of the network. When MAAS
  is managing the bridge and bringing networks up and down, set the
  ```disable-network-management``` option in environments.yaml to "true":

  ```yaml
  disable-network-management: true
  ```

  This tells Juju not to create a network bridge or to bring eth0
  up and down during cloud-init. Juju will not make changes to the
  network config when its agents start.


  ### Improved availability zone selection in OpenStack and MAAS

  The OpenStack and MAAS providers now attempt to start instances in all
  available zones until they find one which succeeds, rather than trying
  just the first zone and failing. This aligns OpenStack and MAAS
  behaviour with that of AWS.


  ### Juju now prefers SSD storage in AWS

  When deploying workloads onto AWS, images with SSD volumes are now
  preferred. If no such images are available, an image using EBS storage
  will be used as a fallback.


  ### Adding many machines

  Juju's ```add-machine``` command now accepts the "-n" option to add many
  machines. For example, to add two machines:

  ```bash
  juju add-machine -n 2
  ```

  The "-n" option can be combined with placement. You can add two LXC
  containers to machine 1 thusly:

  ```bash
  juju add-machine lxc:1 -n 2
  ```


  ### Choosing the nodes used to ensure high availability

  Just as ```juju bootstrap``` supports the ability to specify a particular
  node using "--to" placement directives, so too can 
  ```juju ensure-availability``` specify a comma separated list of machines to use
  for any newly required state servers. For example:

  ```bash
  juju ensure-availability -n 3 --to name1,name2
  ```


  ### Inspecting the API connection settings

  The ```juju api-info``` command shows the settings used to connect to the
  Juju state-server's API. You can see the settings for all the fields
  (except for password) like so:

  ```bash
  juju api-info
  ```

  If you want to see the password being used, you need to either use the
  "--password" option:

  ```bash
  juju api-info --password
  ```

  or specify the password field as the only field to show:

  ```bash
  juju api-info password
  ```

  You can learn the value of any field by including it in the command
  line. For example, to learn the name of user created during bootstrap,
  type:

  ```bash
  juju api-info user
  ```


  ### Managing who can connect to the Juju environment

  Juju now supports multiple people connecting to the environment with
  their own identity and credentials.

  When an environment is bootstrapped the "admin" user is created (this
  will change with 1.22 to reflect the name of the logged in user).

  Even though there is support for multiple users, there is not yet support
  for fine grain permissions. These will come in time. The
  only permission checked at this stage is that only the "admin" user
  can create or disable other users. Any user is now able to change
  their own password.

  The user commands are grouped under the ```juju user``` command:
 
  ```bash
  juju user
  usage: juju user <command> ...
  purpose: manage user accounts and access control
  ```

      "juju user" is used to manage the user accounts and access control
      in the Juju environment.

      commands:
          add - adds a user
          change-password - changes the password of the current user
          disable - disable a user to stop the user logging in
          enable - reenables a disabled user to allow the user
                            to log in
          help - show help on a command or other topic
          info - shows information on a user
          list - shows all users

  You can add a user like this:

  ```bash
  juju user add test "Test User"
  ```

  To generate a random strong password, use the --generate option.

  ```bash
  password:
  type password again:
  user "Test User (test)" added
  environment file written to /home/tim/some-dir/test.jenv
  ```

  The generated environment file still needs to be copied into the user's
  $JUJU_HOME/environments directory in order to be used. Future versions
  of Juju will make this more simple. The name of the environments file
  is the name that the user needs to use to talk to the environment, so
  the user will probably want to rename it too. For example, an
  environment named app-stack will have an env named:

  ```no-highlight
  $JUJU_HOME/environments/app-stack.jenv
  ```

  Juju will ask for a password to be typed in. If you'd prefer a strong
  random password, you can use the "--generate" option. You can also
  control the location and name of the environments file that is created.

  You can see which users have been created using the ```juju user list```
  command:

  ```bash
  juju user list
  NAME DISPLAY NAME DATE CREATED LAST CONNECTION
  admin admin 23 minutes ago just now
  test Test User 5 minutes ago never connected
  thumper Tim 5 seconds ago never connected
  ```

  The output of this command can also be in YAML or JSON using the usual
  "--format" options.

  Any user that is created will be able to access the environment. To
  stop this, you can disable the user.

  ```bash
  juju user disable test
  User "test" disabled

  juju api-info user -e local-test
  test

  juju user info -e local-test
  WARNING discarding API open error: environment "local-test" not found
  ERROR invalid entity name or password
  ```

  Unfortunately the warning there is due to legacy environment support
  that is checked as a fallback when the initial connection failed due to
  the user being disabled.

  Disabled users are not shown by default with the listing:

  ```bash
  juju user list
  NAME DISPLAY NAME DATE CREATED LAST CONNECTION
  admin admin 30 minutes ago just now
  thumper Tim 6 minutes ago never connected
  ```

  But they can be included with the '--all' option:

  ```bash
  juju user list --all
  NAME DISPLAY NAME DATE CREATED LAST CONNECTION
  admin admin 32 minutes ago just now
  test Test User 13 minutes ago 2 minutes ago (disabled)
  thumper Tim 8 minutes ago never connected
  ```

  Disabled users can be enabled again using the enable command:

  ```bash
  juju user enable test
  User "test" enabled

  juju user info -e local-test
  user-name: test
  display-name: Test User
  date-created: 14 minutes ago
  last-connection: just now
  ```

  ### Upgrade robustness

  Many improvements have been made to make Juju software upgrades more
  reliable.

  The upgrade process is now synchronised which is especially important in HA
  environments where multiple state servers exist. The master Juju state
  server now upgrades first, then the other state servers, followed by the
  remaining machines. If one or more state servers fail to start the upgrade
  process within a certain time, the upgrade is aborted and a rollback to the
  previous tools version occurs.

  Upgrade progress is now shown in the Juju status output. A machine will now
  report when it is upgrading and both transient and permanent upgrade errors
  will also be indicated.

  If a machine has trouble with the steps it needs to run to complete an
  upgrade, it will now retry several times. This helps to deal with some
  transient failures.


  ### Rebooting units from charm hooks

  There are several cases where a charm needs to reboot a machine, such as
  after a kernel upgrade, or to upgrade the entire system. The charm may
  not be able to complete the hook until the machine is rebooted.

  The ```juju-reboot``` command allows charm authors schedule a reboot from
  inside a charm hook. The reboot will only happen if the hook completes
  without error. You can schedule a reboot like so:

  ```bash
  juju-reboot
  ```

  The ```--now``` option can be passed to block hook execution. The
  ```juju-reboot``` command will hang until the unit agent stops the hook and
  re-queues it for next run. This will allow you to create multi-step
  install hooks.

  Charm authors must wrap calls to ```juju-reboot``` to ensure it is
  actually necessary, otherwise the charm risks entering a reboot loop.
  The preferred work-flow is to check if the feature/charm is in the
  desired state, and reboot when needed. This bash example assumes that
  "$FEATURE_IS_INSTALLED" variable was defined by a check for the feature,
  then 'juju-reboot' is called if the variable is false:

  ```bash
  if [[ $FEATURE_IS_INSTALLED  == "false" ]]
  then
      install_feature
      juju-reboot --now
  fi
  ```

  The ```juju-reboot``` command can be called from any hook. It can also be called
  using the ```juju run``` command.


  ### Improvements to ports management for charms

  Your charm hooks can call the new ```opened-ports``` shell command to get
  a listing of the open ports on the unit.

  ```bash
  opened-ports
  ```

  The ```open-port``` and ```close-port``` commands both support single ports and
  ranges, for example, to open ports 80 through 100 on tcp:

  ```bash
  open-port 80-100/tcp
  ```

  And you can close a range like so:

  ```bash
  close-port 90-100/tcp
  ```

  Juju now keeps track of what ports are opened by other units on the same
  machine and does not allow conflicting ports to be opened. The
  ```open-port``` and ```close-port``` commands can return a conflict error when
  the port was opened or closed by another charm. Additionally, both
  these commands work transactionally, in common with other
  hook commands; until the hook is committed no actual changes are
  made (opening or closing ports).


  ### Developing Juju providers for clouds without storage

  Storage associated with a particular cloud (S3 for AWS, Swift for
  Openstack etc) was a mandatory requirement when developing a provider to
  allow Juju to deploy workloads to any particular cloud platform. This
  requirement is no longer necessary. Although existing providers still
  use cloud storage (to some extent), new providers can be written without
  needing to provide a storage implementation.


  ### More mirrors for faster bootstraps

  Juju agents are mirrored in the certified public clouds (AWS, Azure,
  HP Cloud, and Joyent) to make bootstraps fast. You do not need to
  do anything to use them, they just work when we add and update them.

  We added mirrors to Joyent. We registered the new regions recently added
  to AWS, Azure, and HP Cloud.

  ### High Availability

  The juju state-server (bootstrap node) can be placed into high
  availability mode. Juju will automatically recover when one or more the
  state-servers fail. You can use the 'ensure-availability' command to
  create the additional state-servers:

  ```bash
  juju ensure-availability
   ```

  The 'ensure-availability' command creates 3 state servers by default,
  but you may use the '-n' option to specify a larger number. The number
  of state servers must be odd. The command supports the 'series' and
  'constraints' options like the 'bootstrap' command. You can learn more
  details by running 'juju ensure-availability --help'


  ### Availability Zone Placement

  Juju supports explicit placement of machines to availability zones
  (AZs), and implicitly spreads units across the available zones.

  When bootstrapping or adding a machine, you can specify the availability
  zone explicitly as a placement directive. e.g.

  ```bash
  juju bootstrap --to zone=us-east-1b
  juju add-machine zone=us-east-1c
  ```
  
  If you don't specify a zone explicitly, Juju will automatically and
  uniformly distribute units across the available zones within the region.
  Assuming the charm and the charm's service are well written, you can
  rest assured that IaaS downtime will not affect your application.
  Commands you already use will ensure your services are always available.
  e.g.

  ```bash
  juju deploy -n 10 <service>
  ```
  
  When adding machines without an AZ explicitly specified, or when adding
  units to a service, the ec2 and openstack providers will now
  automatically spread instances across all available AZs in the region.
  The spread is based on density of instance "distribution groups".

  State servers compose a distribution group: when running 'juju
  ensure-availability', state servers will be spread across AZs. Each
  deployed service (e.g. mysql, redis, whatever) composes a separate
  distribution group; the AZ spread of one service does not affect the AZ
  spread of another service.

  Amazon's EC2 and OpenStack Havana-based clouds and newer are supported.
  This includes HP Cloud. Older versions of OpenStack are not supported.


  ### Azure availability sets

  Azure environments can be configured to use availability sets. This
  feature ensures services are distributed for high availability; as long
  as at least two units are deployed, Azure guarantees 99.95% availability
  of the service overall. Exposed ports will be automatically load
  balanced across all units within the service.

  New Azure environments will have support for availability sets by
  default. To revert to the previous behaviour, the
  'availability-sets-enabled' option must be set in environments.yaml like
  so:
  
  ```yaml
  availability-sets-enabled: false
  ```
  
  Placement is disabled when 'availability-sets-enabled' is true. The
  option cannot be disabled after the environment is bootstrapped.


  ### Juju debug-log Command Supports Filtering and Works with LXC

  The 'debug-log' command shows the consolidate logs of all juju agents
  running on all machines in the environment. The command operates like
  'tail -f' to stream the logs to the your terminal. The feature now
  support local-provider LXC environments. Several options are available
  to select which log lines to display.

  The 'lines' and 'limit' options allow you to select the starting log
  line and how many additional lines to display. The default behaviour is
  to show the last 10 lines of the log. The 'lines' option selects the
  starting line from the end of the log. The 'limit' option restricts the
  number of lines to show. For example, you can see just 20 lines from
  last 100 lines of the log like this:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --lines 100 --limit 20
  ```

  There are many ways to filter the juju log to see just the pertinent
  information. A juju log line is written in this format:

  ```no-highlight
  <entity> <timestamp> <log-level> <module>:<line-no> <message>
  ```

  The 'include' and 'exclude' options select the entity that logged the
  message. An entity is a juju machine or unit agent. The entity names are
  similar to the names shown by 'juju status'. You can exclude all the log
  messages from the bootstrap machine that hosts the state-server like
  this:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --exclude machine-0
  ```

  The options can be used multiple times to select the log messages. This
  example selects all the message from a unit and its machine as reported
  by status:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --include unit-mysql-0 --include machine-1
  ```

  The 'level' option restricts messages to the specified log-level or
  greater. The levels from lowest to highest are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO,
  WARNING, and ERROR. The WARNING and ERROR messages from the log can seen
  thusly:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --level WARNING
  ```

  The 'include-module' and 'exclude-module' are used to select the kind of
  message displayed. The module name is dotted. You can specify all or
  some of a module name to include or exclude messages from the log. This
  example progressively excludes more content from the logs
 
  ```bash
  juju debug-log --exclude-module juju.state.apiserver
  juju debug-log --exclude-module juju.state
  juju debug-log --exclude-module juju
  ```
  
  The 'include-module' and 'exclude-module' options can be used multiple
  times to select the modules you are interested in. For example, you can
  see the juju.cmd and juju.worker messages like this:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --include-module juju.cmd --include-module juju.worker
  ```

  The 'debug-log' command output can be piped to grep to filter the
  message like this:

  ```bash
  juju debug-log --lines 500 | grep amd64
  ```

  You can learn more by running 'juju debug-log --help' and 'juju help
  logging'


  ### Constraints Support instance-type

  You can specify 'instance-type' with the 'constraints' option to
  select a specific image defined by the cloud provider. The
  'instance-type' constraint can be used with Azure, EC2, HP Cloud, and
  all OpenStack-based clouds. For example, when creating an EC2
  environment, you can specify 'm1.small':

  ```bash
  juju bootstrap --constraints instance-type=m1.small
  ```

  Constraints are validated by all providers to ensure values conflicts
  and unsupported options are rejected. Previously, juju would reconcile
  such problems and select an image, possibly one that didn't meet the
  needs of the service.


  ### The lxc-use-clone Option Makes LXC Faster for Non-Local Providers

  When 'lxc-use-clone' is set to true, the LXC provisioner will be
  configured to use cloning regardless of provider type. This option
  cannot be changed once it is set. You can set the option to true in
  environments.yaml like this:

  ```yaml
  lxc-use-clone: true
  ```

  This speeds up LXC provisioning when using placement with any provider.
  For example, deploying mysql to a new LXC container on machine 0 will
  start faster:

  ```bash
  juju deploy --to lxc:0 mysql
  ```


  ### Support for Multiple NICs with the Same MAC

  Juju now supports multiple physical and virtual network interfaces with
  the same MAC address on the same machine. Juju takes care of this
  automatically, there is nothing you need to do.

  Caution, network settings are not upgraded from 1.18.x to 1.20.x. If you
  used juju 1.18.x to deploy an environment with specified networks, you
  must redeploy your environment instead of upgrading to 1.20.0.

  The output of 'juju status'  will include information about networks
  when there is more than one. The networks will be presented in this
  manner:

  ```no-highlight
  machines: ...
  services: ...
  networks:
    net1:
      provider-id: foo
      cidr: 0.1.2.0/24
      vlan-tag: 42
  ```


  ### MaaS Network Constraints and Deploy Argument

  You can specify which networks to include or exclude as a constraint to
  the deploy command. The constraint is used to select a machine to deploy
  the service's units too. The value of 'networks' is a comma-delimited
  list of juju network names (provided by MaaS). Excluded networks are
  prefixed with a "^". For example, this command specify the service
  requires the "logging" and "storage" networks and conflicts with the
  "db" and "dmz" networks.

  ```bash
  juju deploy mongodb --constraints networks=logging,storage,^db,^dmz
  ```

  The network constraint does not enable the network for the service. It
  only defines what machine to pick.

  Use the 'deploy' command's 'networks' option to specify service-specific
  network requirements. The 'networks' option takes a comma-delimited list
  of juju-specific network names. Juju will enable the networks on the
  machines that host service units.

  Juju networking support is still experimental and under development,
  currently only supported with the MaaS provider.

  ```bash
  juju deploy mongodb --networks=logging,storage
  ```

  The 'exclude-network' option was removed from the deploy command as it
  is superseded by the constraint option.

  There are plans to add support for network constraint and argument with
  Amazon EC2, Azure, and OpenStack Havana-based clouds like HP Cloud in
  the future.


  ### MAAS Provider Supports Placement and add-machine

  You can specify which MAAS host to place the juju state-server on with
  the 'to' option. To bootstrap on a host named 'fnord', run this:

  ```bash
  juju bootstrap --to fnord
  ```

  The MAAS provider support the add-machine command now. You can provision
  an existing host in the MAAS-based Juju environment. For example, you
  can  add running machine named fnord like this:

  ```bash
  juju add-machine fnord
  ```


  ### Server Side API Versioning

  The Juju API server now has support for a Version field in requests that
  are made. For this release, there are no RPC calls that require anything
  other than 'version=0' which is the default when no Version is supplied.
  This should have limited impact on existing CLI or API users, since it

  ### Working with Ubuntu 12.04 Precise and 14.04 Trusty

  Juju 1.18.x is the first Juju that is aware of two Ubuntu LTS releases. In the
  past, when bootstrapping the state-server or deploying a charm, Juju selected
  Ubuntu 12.04 Precise when the serie was not specified. If you care about the
  version of Ubuntu used, then you want to specify the series

  You can specify the series of the state-server and set the default charm
  series by adding "default-series" to environments.yaml. Setting "default-
  series" is the only way to specify the series of the state-server (bootstrap
  node). For example, if your local machine is Ubuntu 14.04 trusty, but your
  organisation only supports Ubuntu 12.04 Precise in the cloud, you can add this
  to your environment in environments.yaml:

  ```yaml
  default-series: precise
  ```

  There are many ways to specify the series to deploy with a charm. In most
  cases you don't need to. When you don't specify a series, Juju checks the
  environment's `default-series`, and if that isn't set, Juju asks the charm
  store to select the best series to deploy with the charm. The series of the
  state-server does not restrict the series of the charm. You can use the best
  series for a charm when deploying a service.

  When working with local charms, Juju cannot fall back to the charm store, it
  falls back to the environment's `default-series`. You must specify the series
  in the environment or when deploying the charm. If your environment is
  running, you can add `default-series` like so:

  ```bash
  juju set-environment default-series=precise
  ```

  These commands choose Ubuntu 12.04 Precise when `default-series` is set to
  "precise" in the environment:

  ```bash
  juju deploy cs:precise/mysql
  juju deploy precise/mysql
  juju deploy mysql
  juju deploy local:precise/mysql
  juju deploy loca:mysql
  ```

^# juju-core 1.18.0

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.18.0, is now available. This release
  replaces 1.16.6.


  ### Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.18.0 is available in trusty and backported to earlier series in
  the following PPA [https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable](https://launch
  pad.net/%7Ejuju/+archive/stable)

  If you use the local provider, be sure to install the juju-local package if it
  is not already installed. Juju’s local requirements have changed. Upgrading
  local juju environments without the juju-local package is not advised.


  ### New and Notable

    * Support for proxies
    * Managing authorised ssh keys
    * Backup and restore the state-server (bootstrap node)

    * Timeouts for bootstrap are configurable for environments
    * Bootstrapping the local provider for lxc no longer requires sudo
    * Juju local provider can use clone for faster LXC
    * Juju now supports juju-mongodb, a mongodb tuned for juju’s needs

    * Juju uses tools for the wrong architecture when unable to find correct tools Lp 1227722
    * Call to relation-get failing with 'permission denied' Lp 1239681


  ### Support for proxies

  Proxies can now be configured for the providers in the environments.yaml file,
  or added to an existing environment using "juju set-env" The configuration
  options are:

      - http-proxy
      - https-proxy
      - ftp-proxy
      - no-proxy

  The protocol-specific options accept a URL. The "no-proxy" option accepts a
  comma-separated list of host names or addresses.

  The proxy options are exported in all hook execution contexts, and also
  available in the shell through "juju ssh" or "juju run".

  There are three additional proxy options specific for apt. These are set to be
  the same as the non-apt proxy values, but can be overridden independently:

      - apt-http-proxy
      - apt-https-proxy
      - apt-ftp-proxy

  For example, with a squid-deb-proxy running on a laptop, you can specify the
  apt-http-proxy to use it for the containers by specifying the host machine’s
  network-bridge:

  ```yaml
  apt-http-proxy: http://10.0.3.1:8000
  ```

  ### Managing authorised ssh keys

  Juju's ssh key management allows people other than the person who bootstrapped
  an environment to ssh into Juju machines/nodes. The authorised-keys command
  accepts 4 subcommands:

   * add - add ssh keys for a Juju user
   * delete - delete ssh keys for a Juju user
   * list - list ssh keys for a Juju user
   * import - import Launchpad or Github ssh keys

  `import` can be used in clouds with open networks to pull ssh keys from
  Launchpad or Github. For example:

  ```bash
  juju authorised-keys import lp:wallyworld
  ```

  `add` can be used to import the provided key, which is necessary for clouds
  that do not have internet access.

  Use the key fingerprint or comment to specify which key to delete. You can
  find the fingerprint for a key using `ssh-keygen`.

  Juju cannot not manage existing keys on manually provisioned machines. Juju
  will prepend "Juju:" to the comments of all keys that it adds to a machine.
  These are the only keys it can "list" or "delete".

  Note that keys are global and grant access to all machines. When a key is
  added, it is propagated to all machines in the environment. When a key is
  deleted, it is removed from all machines. You can learn more details by
  running `juju authorised-keys --help`.

  ### Backup and restore state-server (bootstrap node)

  Juju provides backup and restore commands to recover the juju state-server in
  case or failure. The juju backup command creates a tarball of the state-
  server’s configuration, keys, and environment data.

  ```bash
  juju switch my-env
  juju backup
  ```

  The juju restore command creates a new juju bootstrap instance using a backup
  file. It updates the existing instances in the environment to recognise the
  new state-server. The command ensures the state-server is not running before
  it creates the replacement. As with the normal bootstrap command, you can pass
  `--constraints` to setup the new state-server.

  ```bash
  juju switch my-env
  juju restore juju-backup-2014-02-21.tgz
  ```

  You can learn more details by running "juju restore --help".

  ### Run arbitrary commands on some or all instances

  The run command can be used by devops or scripts to inspect or do work on
  services, units, or machines. Commands for services or units are executed in a
  hook context. Charm authors can use the run command to develop and debug
  scripts that run in hooks.

  For example, to run `uname` on every instance:

  ```bash
  juju run "uname -a" --all
  ```

  Or to run uptime on some instances:

  ```bash
  juju run "uptime" --machine=2
  juju run "uptime" --service=mysql
  ```

  You can learn more details by running `juju run --help`.

  ### Use metadata generate-tools instead of sync-tools to generate
  simplestreams metadata

  The `sync-tools` command previously generated simple streams metadata for
  local juju tools when provided with the `--destination` option. This is no
  longer the case. You can create the simple streams metadata for tools thusly:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p $MY_DIR/tools/streams/v1
  mkdir -p $MY_DIR/tools/releases
  cp $PUBLIC_TOOLS/*tgz $MY_DIR/tools/releases
  juju metadata generate-tools -d $MY_DIR
  ```

  Upload the tools directory to your private cloud. Set the tools-metadata-url
  option in the environment’s yaml to point to the tools URL. For more details,
  run "juju metadata --help".

  The bootstrap --source option was replaced with --metadata-source

  The juju bootstrap command previously accepted the `--source` option which was
  the local path to a directory of juju tools. The bootstrap command now has a
  `--metadata-source` option that accepts the local path to simple streams
  metadata and tools. If your workflow previously was to download the juju tools
  to a local directory, then bootstrap with the `--source` option to upload the
  tools to your environment, you need to run `juju metadata generate-tools` per
  the previous section. For more details, run `juju bootstrap --help`.

  ### Timeouts for bootstrap are configurable for environments.

  Environments that need more time to provision an instance can configure 3
  options the environments.yaml. MAAS environments often need to set bootstrap-
  timeout to 1800.

   * bootstrap-timeout (default: 600s)
   * bootstrap-retry-delay (default: 5s)
   * bootstrap-addresses-delay (default: 10s)

  ### Bootstrapping the local-provider for lxc no longer requires sudo

  The Juju bootstrap command cannot be run as root. Bootstrap will prompt for a
  password to use sudo as needed to set up the environment. This addresses
  several issues that arose because the owner and permissions of the local
  environment files were different from the owner of the process. The juju
  status command for example now reports the status of the machines without the
  need to run it with sudo.

  If you have used the local provider before, you may need to manually clean up
  some files that are still owned by root. The environment’s jenv file commonly
  needs to be removed. If your local environment is named "local" then there may
  be a local.jenv owned by root with the JUJU_HOME directory (~/.juju). After
  the local environment is destroyed, you can remove the file like this

  ```bash
  sudo rm ~/.juju/environments/local.jenv
  ```

  Juju local provider can use clone for faster LXC

  The local provider can use lxc-clone to create the containers used as
  machines. This feature is controlled by the "lxc-clone" option. The default is
  "true" for Trusty and above, and "false" for earlier Ubuntu releases. You can
  try to use lxc-clone on earlier releases, but it is not a supported. It may
  well work. You can enable lxc-clone in environments.yaml thusly:

  ```yaml
  lxc-clone: true
  ```

  The local provider is btrfs-aware. If your LXC directory is on a btrfs
  filesystem, the clones use snapshots and are much faster to create and take up
  much less space. There is also support for using aufs as a backing-store for
  the LXC clones, but there are some situations where aufs doesn’t entirely
  behave as intuitively as one might expect, so this must be turned on
  explicitly.

  ```yaml
  lxc-clone-aufs: true
  ```

  When using clone, the first machine to be created will create a "template"
  machine that is used as the basis for the clones. This will be called
  `juju-[series]-template`, so for a precise image, the name is "juju-precise-
  template". Do not modify or start this image while a local provider
  environment is running because you cannot clone a running lxc machine.

  ### Juju now supports juju-mongodb, a mongodb tuned for juju’s needs

  The Juju state-server (bootstrap node) prefers juju-mongodb. The package is
  available in Ubuntu Trusty, the new db will be used when a Trusty environment
  is bootstrapped. The juju-local package on Trusty will install juju-mongodb if
  it is not already installed. Upgrades of the juju-local package will continue
  to use mongodb-server to preserve continuity with existing local environments.

  ### Destroying environments

  The destroy-environment command requires you to specify the environment name:

  ```bash
  juju destroy-environment my-press-site
  ```

  Previously, destroy-environment would destroy the current environment, which
  might not be the one you want to destroy.

  ### Juju unset-env

  The unset-env command allows you to reset one or more the environment
  configuration attributes to its default value in a running Juju instance.
  Attributes without defaults are removed. Attempting to remove a required
  attribute with no default will result in an error. Multiple attributes may be
  removed at once; keys are space-separated.

  ```bash
  juju unset-env
  ```


  ### Juju retry-provisioning

  You can use the retry-provisioning command in cases where deploying services,
  adding units, or adding machines fails. The command allows you to specify
  machines which should be retried to resolve errors reported in status.

  For example, after you deployed 100 units and machines, status reports that
  machines 3, 27 and 57 could not be provisioned because of a rate limit
  exceeded error. You can ask juju to retry:

  ```bash
  juju retry-provisioning 3 27 5
  ```

  ### Bash completions include flags, machines, services, and units

  Bash command line completions are improved. Pressing the TAB key will complete
  juju commands and their flags. Completion will also look up the machines,
  services, and units in an environment and suggest them.

^# juju-core 1.16.6

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.16.6, is now available. This release
  replaces 1.16.5.

  ### Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.16.6 is available in trusty and backported to earlier series in
  the following PPA [https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable](https://launchpad.net/%7Ejuju/+archive/stable)

  ### Resolved issues

    * Azure provider handles 307 temporary redirects poorly Lp 1269835
    * Loading state on bootstrap ignores ssl-hostname-verification setting Lp 1268913
    * Provide remove-* aliases for destroy-service and destroy-machine Lp 1261628

  ### Notable Changes

  This release addresses intermittent failures observed in recent weeks in
  Azure. Users may have seen “(request failed...307: Temporary Redirect)” when
  issuing juju commands.

  The destroy-service and destroy-machine commands were renamed to remove-
  service and remove-machine respectively. The commands are still available
  under their old names; no scripts were harmed in the making of this release.

^# juju-core 1.16.5

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.16.5, is now available. This release
  replaces 1.16.4.


  ### Getting Juju

   * [maas] juju set-env fails after upgrading to 1.16.2+ Lp 1256179
   * juju destroy-environment destroys other environments Lp 1257481


  ### Notable Changes

  Juju may report the status of a service and machine that was terminated
  outside of Juju. Juju did not notice that the machine is gone. This release
  provides minor fixes to identify the case, and a feature to explicitly tell
  juju that the machine is gone.

  ```bash
  juju destroy-machine --force
  ```

  The destroy-machine command will destroy the machine as needed, and remove it
  from its list of available machines. Machines that are responsible for the
  environment cannot be destroyed. Machines running units or containers can only
  be destroyed with the --force flag; doing so will also destroy all those units
  and containers without giving them any opportunity to shut down cleanly.

  Future version of Juju will notice when machines _disappear_ without the need
  of `destroy-machine --force`.

  ### New and Notable

    * bootstrap now matches on major and minor version numbers when locating tools
    * public-bucket-url is deprecated, use tools-url and/or image-metadata-url instead
    * users running from source no longer need to manually specify --upload-tools in order to have tools available for bootstrapping
    * tools retrieval is now handled using simplestreams metadata, similar to how image id lookup works
    * tools no longer have to be located in a publicly readable cloud storage instance; they can be served by any HTTP server eg apache
    * new constraint: tags. This constraint is currently only supported by MaaS environments, and allows you to specify nodes by tags applied to them in MaaS. Example: juju deploy mysql --constraints tags=foo,bar will deploy mysql to a node that is tagged with both the "foo" tag and the "bar" tag.
    * the "null" provider is now available, for creating environments with existing machines.
    * admin-secret is now chosen automatically if omitted from the configuration of a new environment.
    * control-bucket is now chosen automatically if omitted from the configuration for new ec2 and openstack environments.
    * Logging has changed. You can specify an environment variable "JUJU_LOGGING_CONFIG", or you can specify --logging-config on the command line. To show the log on the command line, now use --show-log. The --debug has been kept to be short-hand for `--logging-config==DEBUG --show-log`, and --verbose has been deprecated with its current meaning.


  ### Resolved issues

    * "juju add-machine ssh:..." no longer fails when an IP address is specified instead of a hostname. LP #1225825
    * Bootstrap nodes will now only run one copy of Mongodb, this will result in lower resource utilisation and faster startup of the bootstrap node. Closes LP #1210407
    * EC2 accounts in default VPC mode now work with juju. LP #1221868
    * The unset command is now available from the command line. LP #1237929 Configuration changes
    * tools-url is a new configuration option used to specify the location where the tools tarballs may be found. If specified, this overrides the default tools repository.
    * image-metadata-url is a new configuration option used to specify the location where image metadata may be found. This is only normally required for private Openstack deployments.
    * public-bucket-url is deprecated - use tools-url to specify where tools are located (if not handled automatically by your cloud provider).

  ### Testing on Canonistack and HP Cloud

  Starting with this release, there is no longer any requirement to use a
  public-bucket-url configuration attribute when bootstrapping Canonistack or HP
  Cloud environments. The public-bucket-url attribute is deprecated and you are
  advised to remove it from your environment configuration.

  ### Bootstrapping and tools

  When Juju bootstraps an environment, it searches for a tools tarball matching
  the version of the Juju client used to run the bootstrap. Prior to this
  release, any tools with the same major version number as the Juju client were
  considered a match. Starting with this release, both the major and minor
  version numbers must match. This is to prevent any subtle and hard to find
  bugs due to version mismatch from manifesting themselves.

  For users of Juju on EC2, HP Cloud, Azure, and Canonistack, where the tools
  are maintained by Canonical in the cloud itself, and MASS, with access to the
  web to download the tools, there will be no noticeable change. For private
  cloud setups, more care will be needed to ensure all the required tools
  tarballs are available.

  ### Configuring tools

  A focus of this release is to make bootstrapping a Juju environment work
  better out of the box, eliminating the need for manual configuration steps. To
  this end, the following improvements are delivered:

    1. HP Cloud and Canonistack users no longer need any special configuration over and above what goes into any generic Openstack setup for Juju.
    2. Users who compile and run Juju from source can bootstrap without manually having to tell Juju to upload a custom tools tarball. The upload-tools bootstrap option is still available to force a tools upgrade, but it is no longer required just to bootstrap the first time or when starting again after an environment has been destroyed.

  Users who wish to run Juju in HP Cloud from scratch can now just follow the
  same steps as used for EC2:

    1. run juju init
    2. source a credentials file containing username, password, region etc, or edit the newly created `~/.juju/environments.yaml` file to add username, password, region etc to the hpcloud environment block
    3. run juju bootstrap -e hpcloud

  HP Cloud users can run juju switch hpcloud to make the default environment
  hpcloud and remove the need to use the -e parameter with each Juju command.

  ### Private Openstack deployments

  Tools can now be served by any http server, or from a shared mounted directory
  accessible from the cloud, removing the requirement to place the tools in a
  cloud storage instance. Using a cloud storage instance is still possible of
  course, but this option may be more desirable for users who wish to set up a
  private cloud without outgoing web access. The steps are as follows:

    1. Copy the tools tarballs for a given Juju version to a directory named like: /tools/releases
    2. run juju sync-tools --all --source= --destination=
    3. Configure your http server to serve to contents of under http://
    4. Add tools-url: http:// to your environments.yaml file.

  An alternative to using http is to copy the tools directory itself, from , to
  a shared drive which is accessible to client machines and cloud instances via
  a common mounted directory. In that case, add an entry like this to your
  environments.yaml:

  ```yaml
  tools-url: file://mounted_dir
  ```

  Users who still wish to place the tools in a cloud instance should copy the
  tools directory itself to a publicly readable storage instance. Thenadd the
  tools-url entry to environments.yml:

  ```yaml
  tools-url: https:///tools
  ```

  A final alternative for locating tools is to copy the entire tools directory
  created above to the cloud’s control bucket, as specified in the
  environments.yaml file. No tools-url configuration is required, but note that
  these tools will only be visible to that one particular Juju environment.

  ### Configuring image metadata

  Just as private Openstack deployments need to configure where tools are
  located, so too does the location of the image metadata need to be specified.
  This is not applicable for supported openstack clouds like HP Cloud and
  Canonistack, only private deployments. Prior to this release, the public-
  bucket-url was used to point to the location of the metadata. Now, configure
  the image-metadata-url as follows:

  ```yaml
  image-metadata-url: /juju-dist
  ```

  Note that the image metadata no longer has to be kept in a cloud storage
  instance. The above example simply assumes the metadata will be kept in the
  same location as prior to this release. But as with tools, the image metadata
  may be server from any http url or even a directory using `file://`

^# juju-core 1.14.1

  A new stable release of Juju, juju-core 1.14.1, is now available.

  This release replaces juju-core 1.14.0. It reconciles differences between juju
  clients.

  ### Getting Juju

  juju-core 1.14.1 is available in Saucy and backported to earlier series in the
  following PPA

  [https://launchpad.net/~juju/+archive/stable](https://launchpad.net/%7Ejuju/+archive/stable)

  ### New and Notable

    * The Microsoft Azure provider is now considered ready for use.
    * lp # 1184786 juju cli now gives a clearer error message when the deprecated default-image-id key is found.
    * When debugging hooks, juju will set the $PS1 value to $JUJU_UNIT_NAME:$JUJU_HOOK_NAME %. This results in a shorter and more useful prompt. Closes ##1212903
    * Juju plugins no longer required the caller to escape all arguments passed to the plugin.
    * The new command “juju unset …” allows a configuration setting for a service to be removed. Removing the configuration setting will revert it to the charm default. This is the first step in solving #1194945.
    * The Windows Azure provider now defines a public storage container for tools. No configuration changes are required. Closes #1216770.
    * The debug-hooks subcommand is now implemented. Closed issue #1027876
    * The status subcommand now accepts service/unit filters, to limit output; see “juju help status” for more information. Partially addresses issue #1121916
    * The juju cli command now returns a better error message when run against an environment that has not been bootstrapped. Closes issue #1028053.

  ### Resolved issues

    * The destroy-environment subcommand now requests confirmation before running, with an option to quietly proceed (-y/--yes). Closed issue #1121914.
    * The cost calculation for the openstack provider was updated to bias towards the lowest number of CPU cores when choosing a machine type matching the provided instance constraints. This closes issue #1210086.
    * The unit agent now removes stale sockets when restarting. Closes #1212916
    * A bug relating to the formatting of tool versions has been resolved. This formatting error was only visible when using the -v or --debug flag. Closes #1216285.
    * lp #1206628 a bug related to the name of an upstart job created for a service unit has been corrected.
    * lp # 1207230 a bug related specifying the type of local provider container has been corrected.

  ### Known issues

    * The JUJU_ENV environment variable is not being passed down to plugins. LP #1216254.

  ### Testing on Canonistack and HP Cloud

  A publicly readable bucket has been created for holding the Juju tools on
  Canonistack. To use it, put this in your ~/.juju/environments.yaml (all on one
  line):

      public-bucket-url: https://swift.canonistack.canonical.com/v1/AUTH_526ad877f3e3464589dc1145dfeaac60

  For HP Cloud the public bucket is available at:

      public-bucket-url: https://region-a.geo-1.objects.hpcloudsvc.com/v1/60502529753910
