Title: Configuring Juju for the Scaleway provider  

# Configuring for Scaleway

!!! **Note:** This provider is in "beta" and makes use of
[manual provisioning](config-manual.html). Manual provisioning allows Juju
users to implement any cloud provider's API calls and acts similar to a
standard provider implemented via the Juju project. You can access the provider
source code on [github](https://github.com/scaleway/juju-scaleway)

This package provides a CLI plugin for Juju that allows automated provisioning
of C1 BareMetal SSD servers on Scaleway.

[Scaleway](https://scaleway.com) is the first IaaS provider worldwide to offer
an ARM based cloud. Itâ€™s the ideal platform for horizontal scaling. The
solution provides on-demand resources: SSD storage, movable IPs, images,
security groups, and object storage.

This plugin is highly inspired from [kAPIlt](https://github.com/kAPIlt) Juju
plugins.


## Requirements

!!! **Note:** This process requires you to have an Scaleway account.

- You have an account and are logged into [cloud.scaleway.com](https://cloud.scaleway.com)
- You have configured your [SSH Key](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/configure-new-ssh-key/)
- You have installed libffi-dev and libssl-dev


## Installation

Plugin installation is done via 'pip', the Python package manager, available by
default on Ubuntu.

A [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is also
recommended to sandbox this install from your system packages:

```bash
pip install -U juju-scaleway
```

## Configuration

### Scaleway API keys

Before you can start using Juju with Scaleway, you will need to get an API token.
API tokens are unique identifiers associated with your Scaleway account.

To get one, open the pull-down menu on your account name and click on
the "My Credentials" link.

Then, to generate a new token, click the "Create New Token" button on the right
corner.

In a terminal, export your credentials required by the plugin using environment
variables:

```bash
export SCALEWAY_ACCESS_KEY=<organization_key>
export SCALEWAY_SECRET_KEY=<secret_token>
```

!!! **Note:** As environment variables are not shared between shells, you will
need to repeat this operation for every shell.  You can avoid this repetition
by adding this environment variables in your shell's rc files, for instance
append them to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

### Juju configuration

Next, add an environment for Scaleway in '~/.juju/environments.yaml'. This
environment will look like the following:

```yaml
# https://jujucharms.com/docs/config-scaleway.html
scaleway:
    type: manual
    bootstrap-host: null
    bootstrap-user: root
```

Then, tell Juju which environment to use:

```bash
export JUJU_ENV=scaleway
```

Set Scaleway as your default provider by running:

```bash
juju switch scaleway
```

## Bootstrapping

You can now bootstrap your Scaleway environment. You need to route the command
through the scaleway plugin that we installed via pip:

```bash
juju scaleway bootstrap
```

All machines created by this plugin will have the Juju environment name as a
prefix for their servers name, for instance `scaleway-XXXYYYZZZ`

After your environment is bootstrapped you can add additional machines to it
via the `add-machine` command, for instance the following will add 2 additional
machines:

```bash
juju scaleway add-machine -n 2
juju status
```

You can now use standard Juju commands to deploy services via charms:

```bash
juju deploy wordpress
```

If you don't specify a machine to place the workload on, the machine
will automatically go to an unused machine within the environment.

You can use manual placement to deploy target particular machines:

```bash
juju deploy mysql --to=2
```

This command deploys a mysql unit to the server number #2

Assemble these workloads together via relations like Lego blocks:

```bash
juju add-relation wordpress mysql
```

You can list all machines in Scaleway that are part of the Juju environment
with the list-machines command. This directly queries the Scaleway API and does
not interact with the Juju API:

```bash
juju scaleway list-machines

Id       Name               Status   Created      Address
6222349  scaleway-0            active   2014-11-25   212.47.239.232
6342360  scaleway-ef19ad5cc... active   2014-11-25   212.47.228.28
2224321  scaleway-145bf7a80... active   2014-11-25   212.47.228.79
```

You can terminate allocated machines via their machine id. By default, the
Scaleway plugin forces the termination of machines, which also terminates any
service unit running on on those machines:

```bash
juju scaleway terminate-machine 1 2
```

And you can destroy the entire environment via:

```bash
juju scaleway destroy-environment
```

The `destroy-environment` command also takes a --force option which only uses
the Scaleway API. It's helpful if the state server or other machines are
killed independently of Juju.
