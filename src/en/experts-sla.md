Title: Managed solutions

# Managed solutions

One professional support option available to you as a Juju operator is to
enlist the help of a *Juju Expert*.

A Juju Expert is a Canonical Ltd. support partner, which deploys and supports
infrastructure based on Juju. We call this type of arrangement a *managed
solution*.

Any support requests beyond the build, workload, and operation of a particular
solution can be escalated, by the Expert, to Canonical by means of their Ubuntu
Advantage support framework. The escalated support case will be treated by
Canonical at the same support level currently ascribed to the partner
(Essential, Standard, or Advanced). See
[Ubuntu Advantage for Servers][ubuntu-advantage-servers] for more information
on Canonical support levels.

The Juju Expert will provide details such as support levels and costs on a
per-solution basis but ultimately an SLA will be conferred upon a specific Juju
model (see [Models][models]).

Consult the [Juju Experts][juju-experts] page to find a managed solution
partner for your project.

**The remainder of this page describes how a Juju Expert would administer a
managed solution for you.**

## Requirements

The following requirements need to be met before setting an SLA for the first
time:

 1. The Juju operator will need an [Ubuntu SSO][ubuntu-sso] account.
 1. The Juju operator will need to have logged in to [Launchpad][launchpad]
    (via Ubuntu SSO) at least once.

## Setting an SLA

An SLA is set within Juju itself, on a per-model basis, via the `sla` command,
which will trigger a dialog to authenticate to your Ubuntu SSO account.

Two key parameters are needed in order for support to become active:

 1. Support level
 1. Budget limit

Support costs will not be billed for more than the budget limit. If metered
costs exceed this amount, the limit will need to be increased in order for
support to remain active.

For example, to set an Essential SLA on model 'default', with a monthly budget
limit of USD 100:

```bash
juju sla -m default essential --budget 100
```

```no-highlight
Model                   SLA                                                        Message
lxd:admin/default       essential       the new sla will become effective on 2018-11-05   
                                        19:22:31.433640933 +0000 UTC
```

The SLA for a model is shown at the top of the output to the `status` command:

```
Model    Controller  Cloud/Region         Version    SLA        Timestamp
default  lxd         localhost/localhost  2.5-beta1  essential  19:42:28Z
.
.
```

It is possible to simply set a support level with the `sla` command:

```bash
juju sla -m default essential
```

The model's budget will then need to be set separately. We'll show how this is
done later on.

## Changing an SLA

An SLA is increased when it moves "up" levels: 'essential' to 'standard' to
'advanced'. An SLA is decreased when it moves "down" levels: 'advanced' to
'standard' to 'essential'.

When an SLA is **increased** the resulting support level becomes effective
immediately. When an SLA is **decreased** the resulting support level becomes
effective in the next monthly billing cycle.

## Budgeting managed models

SLA budgets are organized into *wallets*. A wallet called 'primary' is created
when the `sla` command is run for the first time. It gets hardcoded as the
default wallet. The sum of all budgets in a wallet cannot exceed the wallet
limit.

### Managing wallets

List your wallets with the `wallets` command:

```bash
juju wallets
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
Wallet          Monthly Budgeted        Available       Spent
primary*           1000      100           999.89        0.11
Total              1000      100           999.89        0.11
                                                             
Credit limit:     10000
```

The default wallet is shown with an asterisk "\*". SLA budgets are allocated
from this wallet if the wallet name is not specified.

The *credit limit* is the maximum monthly limit approved to spend on SLAs. You
can submit a request to Canonical to have this limit increased. This is done
via an escalated support case. See section
[Escalating a support case][#escalating-a-support-case].

View the budgets allocated from a wallet with the `show-wallet` command:

```bash
juju show-wallet primary
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
Model                   Spent   Budgeted         By    Usage
lxd:admin/default       0.22         100        bob    0%   
                                                            
Total                   0.22         100               0%   
Wallet                              1000                    
Unallocated                          900
```

You may update the budget limit for a model with the `budget` command:

```bash
juju budget -m lxd:admin/default 200
```

Finally, to view all the budgets associated with a wallet the `show-wallet`
command is used:

```bash
juju show-wallet primary
```

Sample output:

```
Model                   Spent   Budgeted         By    Usage
lxd:admin/default       2.42         200        bob    1%   
lxd:admin/alpha         0.00         150        bob    0%   
                                                            
Total                   2.42         350               1%   
Wallet                              1000                    
Unallocated                          650
```

The budget limit may be lowered for a model, but not below its current spent
value.

### Advanced budgeting

Additional wallets may be created for accounting or organizational purposes
with the `create-wallet` command:

```bash
juju create-wallet demo 50
```

Verify the creation of the new wallet by listing the wallets again:

```bash
juju wallets
```

Sample output:

```no-highlight
Wallet          Monthly Budgeted        Available       Spent
demo                 50        0            50.00        0.00
primary*           1000      350           997.58        2.42
Total              1050      350          1047.58        2.42
                                                             
Credit limit:     10000
```

To allocate a budget (using either the `sla` command or the `budget` command)
from a specific wallet use the form: `<wallet>:<limit>`. Here are two
examples:

```bash
juju sla essential demo:40
juju budget primary:25
```

## Metering

Metering begins once the following have occurred:

 - an SLA has been assigned to a model
 - a budget has been allocated to a model
 - the model takes on a workload
 
When metering is underway the output to the `status` command will include an
extra section:

```no-highlight
.
.
Entity  Meter status  Message
model   green
.
.
```

A 'Meter' value of **green** (displayed with a green colour in the terminal)
indicates that the customerâ€™s payment method is in good standing. A value of
**amber** indicates a condition puts future payment for continued use at risk
(e.g. spending is occurring at a rate likely to exceed the monthly limit). A
value of **red** indicates that continued use of the workload will not be paid
for (e.g. budget limit exceeded, problem with payment method). The 'Message'
column will be updated with appropriate details.

Determining factors for actual metering costs (e.g. fixed per-hour rate,
per-unit hour, etc.) are negotiated between the customer and the Expert.

## Escalating a support case

When it comes time to request help from Canonical you can file a support case
here:

[https://jujucharms.com/support/create][jaas-support]

You would also request an increase to the monthly credit limit via a support
case.
