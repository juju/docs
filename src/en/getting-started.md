# Introduction

This tutorial will explain how to get started with Juju, including installing,
configuring, and bootstrapping a new Juju environment. Prerequisites include:

  - An Ubuntu, OSX, or Windows machine to install the client upon.
  - An environment which can provide a new server with an Ubuntu cloud operating
  system image on-demand. This includes services such as Amazon EC2, HP Cloud,
  an OpenStack installation, or your local machine
  - An SSH key-pair. On Linux and Mac OSX: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` On Windows:
  See the [Windows instructions for SSH and PuTTY](getting-started-keygen-win.html)

# Installation

## Ubuntu

To install Juju, you simply need to grab the latest juju-core package from the
PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install juju-core
```

For more information on installing and the current versions available, see
[the releases page](reference-releases.html).

## Mac OSX

Juju is in [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), to install do:

```bash
brew install juju
```

We also recommend trying Juju in [our Vagrant box](config-vagrant.html).

For more installation information and what versions are available, see
[the releases page](reference-releases.html).

## Windows

See [the releases page](reference-releases.html) to download and run the
latest version of the Juju Windows installer.

We also recommend trying Juju in [our Vagrant box](config-vagrant.html).

# Configuring

Juju needs to be configured to use your cloud provider. This is done via the
following file:

## Linux & Mac OSX

```no-highlight
~/.juju/environments.yaml
```

## Windows

```no-highlight
%APPDATA%\Juju\environments.yaml
```

 %APPDATA% is typically defined as C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming

Juju can automatically generate the file in this way:

```bash
juju generate-config
```

This action will not overwrite an existing file but merely dump the information
onscreen (STDOUT). It will contain sample profiles for different types of cloud
services.  Edit it to provide specific information for your chosen cloud
provider. For more specifics on what needs to be changed, see the relevant
sections in the left pane (under *Install & Configure*).

**Note:** Juju's command line interface includes documentation, running `juju
help` will show you the topics. You can also look at the
[Juju command cheatsheet](https://github.com/juju/cheatsheet) if you are
looking for a convenient command guide.

# Testing your setup

The first step is to create a bootstrap environment. This is a cloud instance
that Juju will use to deploy and manage services. It will be created according
to the configuration you have provided, and your public SSH key will be
uploaded automatically so that Juju can communicate securely with the
bootstrap instance.

```bash
juju bootstrap
```

**Note:** If you have multiple environments configured, you can choose which one
to address with a particular command by adding the `-e` switch followed by the
environment name, E.g. `-e hpcloud`.

You may have to wait a few moments for this command to return, as it needs to
perform various tasks and contact your cloud provider.

Assuming it returns successfully, we can now deploy some services and explore
the basic operations of Juju.

To start with, we will deploy WordPress:

```bash
juju deploy wordpress
```

Juju will download and use the WordPress charm, through the bootstrap instance,
to request and deploy whatever resources it needs to install this service.

Since WordPress requires a database, we will deploy one:

```bash
juju deploy mysql
```

Again, Juju will do whatever is necessary to deploy this service for you,
and it may take some time for the command to return.

**Note:** If you want to get more information on what is actually happening,
or to help resolve problems, you can add the `--show-log` switch to the juju
command to get verbose output.

Although we have deployed WordPress and a MySQL database, they are not linked
together in any way yet. To do this we run:

```bash
juju add-relation wordpress mysql
```

This command uses information provided by the relevant charms to associate these
services with each other in whatever way makes sense. There is much more to be
said about linking services together which is covered in the Juju command
documentation, but for the moment, we just need to know that it will link these
services together.

In order to make our WordPress public, we now need to expose this service:

```bash
juju expose wordpress
```

This service will now be configured to respond to web requests, so visitors can
see it. But where exactly is it? If we run the `juju status` command, we will be
able to see what services are running, and where they are located.

```bash
juju status
```

The output from this command should look something like this:

```no-highlight
machines:
  "0":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-50-16-167-135.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-781bf614
    series: precise
  "1":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-23-22-225-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-9e8927f6
    series: precise
  "2":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-54-224-220-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-5c440436
    series: precise
services:
  mysql:
    charm: cs:precise/mysql-18
    exposed: false
    relations:
      db:
      - wordpress
    units:
      mysql/0:
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.10.0
        machine: "1"
        public-address: ec2-23-22-225-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  wordpress:
    charm: cs:precise/wordpress-12
    exposed: true
    relations:
      db:
      - mysql
      loadbalancer:
      - wordpress
    units:
      wordpress/0:
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.10.0
        machine: "2"
        public-address: ec2-54-224-220-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

There is quite a lot of information here. The first section, titled
**machines:**, details all the instances which are currently running. For each
you will see the version of Juju they are running, their hostname, instance id
and the series or version of Ubuntu they are running.

After that, the sections list the services which are currently deployed. The
information here differs slightly according to the service and how it is
configured. It will, however, always list the charm that was used to deploy the
service, whether it is exposed or not, its address and what relations
exist.

From this readout, we can see that WordPress is exposed and ready. If we
point a web browser at the address we should be able to access it:

Congratulations, you have just deployed a service with Juju!

Now you are ready to deploy whatever service you want from the 100s
available at the [Juju Charm Store.](https://jujucharms.com).

To remove all current deployments and clear everything in your cloud, you can
run:

```bash
juju destroy-environment <environment-name>
```

Where `<environment-name>` is the name you gave the environment when you
configured it. A warning will be displayed and the user will be prompted whether
or not to continue. This action will remove everything in the specified
environment, including the bootstrap node.

See the [charm documentation](./charms.html) to learn more about charms,
including configuring options and managing running systems.
