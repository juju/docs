# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to get started with Juju, including installing,
configuring and bootstrapping a new Juju environment. Before you start you will
need:

  - An Ubuntu, OSX or Windows machine to install the client on.
  - An environment which can provide a new server with an Ubuntu cloud operating system image on-demand. This includes services such as Amazon EC2, HP Cloud, an OpenStack installation, or your local machine
  - An SSH key-pair. If you have not already set one up, you need to generate an appropriate keypair. On Linux and Mac OSX: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` On Windows: See the [Windows instructions for SSH and PuTTY](getting-started-keygen-win.html)

# Installation

## Ubuntu

To install Juju, you simply need to grab the latest juju-core package from the
PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install juju-quickstart

## Mac OSX

Juju is in [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), to install do:

    brew install juju-quickstart

**Note:** To install brew run `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)`
 and ensure [Xcode is installed](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).

## Windows

Download and run the [Juju windows installer](https://juju.ubuntu.com/install/).

# Configuring

Now the Juju software is installed, it needs to be configured to use your
particular cloud provider. This is done by generating and editing a file,
`environments.yaml`, which will live in your `~/.juju/` directory on Linux and
OSX, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Juju` on Windows. You can generate the environments file
manually, but Juju also includes a boilerplate configuration option that will
flesh out most of the file for you and minimise the amount of work (and
potential errors).

To generate an initial config file, you simply need to run:

    juju quickstart

This command will launch the quickstart config environment, where you can automatically
generate config files for each cloud Juju supports and write it to
`~/.juju/environments.yaml`.

This file will contain sample profiles for different types of cloud services,
but you will need to edit the files to provide specific information for your
cloud provider. Sections are created for Amazon (AWS) services, HPCloud and a
generic OpenStack instance (and for the local provider if running on Linux). For
more specifics on what needs to be changed, see the relevant sections below.

  - [Configuring for Amazon AWS](config-aws.html)
  - [Configuring for Windows Azure](config-azure.html)
  - [Configuring for HP Cloud](config-hpcloud.html)
  - [Configuring for OpenStack](config-openstack.html)
  - [Configuring for bare metal using MAAS](config-maas.html)
  - [Configuring for LXC local provider (Linux)](config-local.html)

**Note:** Juju's command line interface includes documentation, doing `juju help` will show you the topics. You can also check out the [Juju command cheatsheet](https://github.com/juju/cheatsheet) if you are looking for a handy command guide.

# Testing your setup

Once you have installed and configured Juju, it is probably a good idea to take
it for a bit of a test drive and check that everything is working as expected.
Because Juju makes it really easy to deploy services, this is actually quick and
straightforward.

The first thing to do is set up a bootstrap environment. This is an instance in
the cloud that Juju will use to deploy and control other services with. By
default quickstart will offer you the option to automatically create and
bootstrap a local environment, just follow its instructions.

To fire off an environment manually you can always:

    juju bootstrap

**Note:** If you have multiple environments configured, you can choose which one to address with a particular command by adding the `-e` switch followed by the environment name, E.g. `-e hpcloud`.

You may have to wait a few moments for this command to return, as it needs to
perform various tasks and contact your cloud provider.

Assuming it returns successfully, we can now deploy some services and explore
the basic operations of Juju.

To start with, we will deploy Wordpress, by running this command:

    juju deploy wordpress

Now juju will fetch the Wordpress charm and use it, through the bootstrap
instance to request and deploy whatever resources it needs to set up this
service.

Wordpress needs a database though, so we will also deploy one of those:

    juju deploy mysql

Once again, juju will do whatever is necessary to deploy this service for you,
and it may take some time for the command to return.

**Note:** If you want to get more information on what is actually happening,
or to help resolve problems, you can add the `--show-log` switch to the juju
command to get verbose output.

Although we have deployed Wordpress and a MySQL database, they are not linked
together in any way yet. To do this we should run:

    juju add-relation wordpress mysql

This command uses information provided by the relevant charms to associate these
services with each other in whatever way makes sense. There is much more to be
said about linking services together which is covered in the juju command
documentation, but for the moment, we just need to know that it will link these
services together.

In order to make our Wordpress public, we now need to expose this service:

    juju expose wordpress

This service will now be configured to respond to web requests, so visitors can
see it. But where exactly is it? If we run the juju status command, we will be
able to see what services are running, and where they are located.

    juju status

The output from this command should look something like this:

```yaml
machines:
  "0":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-50-16-167-135.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-781bf614
    series: precise
  "1":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-23-22-225-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-9e8927f6
    series: precise
  "2":
    agent-state: started
    agent-version: 1.10.0
    dns-name: ec2-54-224-220-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    instance-id: i-5c440436
    series: precise
services:
  mysql:
    charm: cs:precise/mysql-18
    exposed: false
    relations:
      db:
      - wordpress
    units:
      mysql/0:
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.10.0
        machine: "1"
        public-address: ec2-23-22-225-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  wordpress:
    charm: cs:precise/wordpress-12
    exposed: true
    relations:
      db:
      - mysql
      loadbalancer:
      - wordpress
    units:
      wordpress/0:
        agent-state: started
        agent-version: 1.10.0
        machine: "2"
        public-address: ec2-54-224-220-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

There is quite a lot of information here. the first section, titled
**machines:**, details all the instances which are currently running. For each
you will see the version of Juju they are running, their hostname, instance id
and the series or version of Ubuntu they are running.

After that, the sections list the services which are currently deployed. The
information here differs slightly according to the service and how it is
configured. It will however, always list the charm that was used to deploy the
service, whether it is exposed or not, its address and whatever relationships
exist.

From this status readout, we can see that wordpress is exposed and ready. If we
simply copy the address into a web browser, we should be able to see it running

Congratulations, you have just deployed a service with Juju!

Now you are ready to deploy whatever service you really want from the 100s
available at the [Juju Charm Store.](http://jujucharms.com)

To remove all current deployments and clear up everything in your cloud, you can run the command:

    juju destroy-environment  <environment-name>

Where the `<environment-name>` is the name you gave the environment when you configured it. This
extra details is to help prevent accidents! You will also see a warning and will be prompted
whether or not to continue - this action will remove everything, including the bootstrap node.

To learn more about charms, including configuring options and managing running
systems, you should continue to [read the charm documentation.](./charms.html)
