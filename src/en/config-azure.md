# Configuring for Windows Azure

This process requires you to have an Windows Azure account. If you have not
signed up for one yet, it can obtained at http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/.

You can configure Juju for use with Azure by issuing the following command:

    juju quickstart -i

And follow the instructions for generating a config for Azure by scrolling down
to "Create a new environment" and selecting "new Windows Azure environment" and
then fill in the appropriate fields.

You can also manually generate a generic configuration file for Juju, using the
command:

    juju generate-config

This will generate a file, `environments.yaml`, which will live in your
`~/.juju/` directory (and will create the directory if it doesn't already
exist).

**Note:** The above command will not overwrite your existing environments.yaml
file, or output to stdout. In order to see the boilerplate environment.yaml on
stdout you need to append the `--show` option. This is helpful if you have an
existing environment.yaml and just need to add a section. For example:

    juju generate-config --show

You can then copy and paste the needed section.

The generic configuration sections generated for Windows Azure will look
something like this:

    # https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/config-azure.html
        azure:
            type: azure
            # location specifies the place where instances will be started,
            # for example: West US, North Europe.
            #
            location: West US
            # The following attributes specify Windows Azure Management
            # information. See:
            # http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure
            # for details.
            #
            management-subscription-id: <00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000>
            management-certificate-path: /home/me/azure.pem
            # storage-account-name holds Windows Azure Storage info.
            #
            storage-account-name: abcdefghijkl
            # force-image-name overrides the OS image selection to use a fixed
            # image for all deployments. Most useful for developers.
            #
            # force-image-name: b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-13_10-amd64-server-DEVELOPMENT-20130713-Juju_ALPHA-en-us-30GB
            # image-stream chooses a simplestreams stream to select OS images
            # from, for example daily or released images (or any other stream
            # available on simplestreams).
            #
            # image-stream: "released"

This is the configuration environments.yaml file needed to run on Windows Azure.
You will need to set the `management-subscription-id`,
`management-certificate-path`, and `storage-account-name`.

**Note:** Other than `location` the other key vaule defaults are recommended,
but can be updated to your preference.

**Note:** Ensure that you set `management-certificate-path` is set to use the
.pem file, NOT the .cer file, doing so will result in an
[out of memory error](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/juju-core/+bug/1250007).

## Config Values

Generate a new certificate for juju usage (or use an existing one). Suggest to
use a 'Common Name' with 'Juju' in it so its obvious in the web UI later. Run
the following commands on Ubuntu to generate a new certificate:

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout azure.pem -out azure.pem
    openssl x509 -inform pem -in azure.pem -outform der -out azure.cer
    chmod 600 azure.pem

Login to the Windows Azure console @
[https://manage.windowsazure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com). From here
you can gather the following information:

- **Settings** Left Navigation: get the `SUBSCRIPTION ID` of the account you upload to. This will be used for the `management-subscription-id`
- **Settings** Left Navigation: "upload" the MyCert.cer file above (if you created one). This is the certificate you used for the `management-certificate-path`
- **Storage** Left Navigation:
  - Click New (bottom left)
  - Click Quick Create
  - Add a name in url (for example `juju0useast0`). This is the value to be used for `storage-account-name`.
  - Select Location (for example: East US)
  - Select Subscription
  - Disable "Enable Geo-Replication" (not applicable)

**Note:** You must create the storage account in the same region/location
specified by the `location` key value. For example, if `location: West US` is
set then `storage-account-name:` must also have a storage set up in `West US`.
Failure to do so will result in a group affinity error.

Ensure the environments.yaml is configured with the above values and save.
