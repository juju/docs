TODO:  How to remove a static volume?

# Persistent storage and Kubernetes

*This is in connection to the topic of
[Using Kubernetes with Juju][clouds-k8s]. See that page for background
information.*

For each Juju-deployed Kubernetes application an *operator pod* is set up
automatically whose task it is to run the charm hooks for each unit. Each charm
also requires such persistent storage so that things like state and resources
can be preserved if the operator pod ever restarts. To accomplish all this, a
Juju storage pool called 'operator-storage' with provider type 'kubernetes' is
required. We call this type of storage *operator storage*.

In addition, a Kubernetes charm may itself require persistent storage (e.g.
the [mariadb-k8s][charm-store-mariadb-k8s] charm). Its Juju storage pool also
has a provider type of 'kubernetes'. We call this type of storage *charm
storage* (or unit storage). As with standard charms, storage requirements are
stated in the charm's `metadata.yaml` file:

```no-highlight
storage:
  database:
    type: filesystem
    location: /var/lib/mysql
```

Currently, only filesystem storage is supported.

Both operator storage and charm storage can be Juju-managed and this is the
recommended method. However, both can also be managed externally to Juju (i.e.
within Kubernetes itself).

Juju-managed storage can be provisioned either dynamically or statically.

Generic Juju storage (non-Kubernetes) is covered on the
[Using Juju Storage][charms-storage] page.

## Juju-managed storage

As mentioned, there are two types of persistent storage that Juju can manage:

 - dynamically provisioned volumes
 - statically provisioned volumes

In both cases, a Juju storage pool needs to be created by the Juju operator.
The second type is needed when the storage system for your chosen backing cloud
is not supported by Kubernetes. This situation therefore demands that volumes
be set up prior to the creation of the storage pool.

!!! Important:
    Static volumes are mainly intended for testing/prototyping. They need the
    Kubernetes [`hostPath`][kubernetes-hostpath] plugin, which only works with
    a cluster consisting of a single worker node.

Juju-managed storage is in contrast to
[external storage][#external-storage-and-storage-precedence-rules], covered
later on.

### Statically provisioned volumes
 
You set up static volumes via YAML definition files. The
[Kubernetes storage classes][kubernetes-classes] page offers details as to the
structure of the file. Here is the generic procedure:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic kubectl
kubectl create -f charm-storage-vol1.yaml
kubectl create -f operator-storage.yaml
```

The example YAML-formatted files `operator-storage.yaml` and
`charm-storage-vol1.yaml` define volumes for operator storage and charm storage
respectively that get created by the `kubectl` command.

Example content of the volume definition files are given below. Typically
multiple charm storage volumes would be required. Note that operator storage
needs a minimum of 1024 MiB.

^# operator-storage.yaml

      kind: PersistentVolume
      apiVersion: v1
      metadata:
        name: op1
      spec:
        capacity:
          storage: 1032Mi
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
        storageClassName: k8s-model-juju-operator-storage
        hostPath:
          path: "/mnt/data/op1"

^# charm-storage-vol1.yaml

      kind: PersistentVolume
      apiVersion: v1
      metadata:
        name: vol1
      spec:
        capacity:
          storage: 100Mi
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
        storageClassName: k8s-model-juju-unit-storage
        hostPath:
          path: "/mnt/data/vol1"

Once a static volume is used, it is never re-used, even if the unit/pod is
terminated and the volume is released. Just as static volumes are manually
created, they must also be manually removed.

!!! Important:
    The storage class name for a statically provisioned volume must be prefixed
    with the name of the intended model. In the examples above, the model name
    is 'k8s-model'. The remainder of the name, for both operator and charm
    storage, are fixed.

## Storage pool creation

Whether or not storage volumes are provisioned statically or dynamically Juju
storage pools must be created. This is done for operator storage and, if a
charm has storage requirements, for charm storage. All on a per-model basis.

For static storage, the number of storage pools is dependent on the storage
classes listed in the PV definition files. The simplest arrangement is to have
a single storage pool for each storage type and this is the approach our
definition files above have taken. The two storage classes are
'k8s-model-juju-operator-storage' and 'k8s-model-juju-unit-storage' .

Naturally, then, during the creation of a storage pool for static volumes the
storage class is needed. However, Juju will automatically prepend the name of
the current model (or that of the model specified via `-m`) to the referenced
storage class name when it informs the cluster. Omit, therefore, the model name
portion of the storage class when creating such a (static) pool.

The storage pool name for operator storage *must* be called 'operator-storage'
while the pool name for charm storage is arbitrary. It is this charm storage
pool that will be used at charm deployment time (`deploy` command). It is also
this command that triggers the actual creation of the Kubernetes storage class
when that storage class is used for the first time.

Juju storage pools are created using the standard `create-storage-pool` command
and by passing values for "pool name", "storage class name", "provisioner", and
optional provisioner-specific parameters. The command's syntax is:

`juju create-storage-pool <pool name> <storage provider> \
	storage-class=<storage class name> \
	storage-provisioner=<provisioner> \
	parameters.type=<paramters>`

In a Kubernetes context, the "storage provider" is always `kubernetes`. This
provider becomes available upon the addition of a Kubernetes model.

For static volumes, the provisioner is `kubernetes.io/no-provisioner`.

For dynamic volumes, the provisioner is dependant upon the underlying
[storage backend][kubernetes-provisioners]. Examples are given in the next two
sections that follow.

The storage class names for both operator storage and charm storage do not need
to be stated. Juju will create a name if one is not explicitly given. This is
not true, however, for static volumes because a volume definition requires a
storage class name.

When creating a pool, if a storage class name is provided, Juju will prefix the
current model's name to that storage class name. For instance, given a model
name of 'k8s-model' and a storage class name of 'juju-operator-storage', the
final storage class name associated with the pool becomes
'k8s-model-juju-operator-storage'. This is really only pertinent when using
static volumes as the complete storage class name must be included in the
volume definition files.

The standard `storage-pools` command is used to list Juju storage pools.

!!! Note:
    As of time of writing, to make use of dynamically provisioned volumes a
    cloud-specific Juju [integrator charm][charm-store-integrator] is required.

### Creating operator storage pools

The below examples show the syntax for creating operator storage pools for
various scenarios.

For AWS using SSD/gp2 backed EBS volumes (dynamically provisioned):

```bash
juju create-storage-pool operator-storage kubernetes \
	storage-class=juju-operator-storage \
	storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/aws-ebs \
	parameters.type=gp2
```

For GCE using Persistent Disk (dynamically provisioned):

```bash
juju create-storage-pool operator-storage kubernetes \
	storage-class=juju-operator-storage \
	storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/gce-pd \
	parameters.type=pd-standard
```

For `microk8s` using built-in hostPath storage (dynamically provisioned):

```bash
juju create-storage-pool operator-storage kubernetes \
	storage-class=microk8s-hostpath
```

For MicroK8s, a special storage class name of 'microk8s-hostpath' is always
used.

For any cloud (statically provisioned):

```bash
juju create-storage-pool operator-storage kubernetes \
	storage-class=juju-operator-storage \
	storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
```
    
### Creating charm storage pools

Creating a charm storage pool is done very similarly to creating an operator
storage pool. The below example creates a pool arbitrarily called 'k8s-pool'
that uses static volumes:

```bash
juju create-storage-pool k8s-pool kubernetes \
	storage-class=juju-unit-storage \
	storage-provisioner=kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
```

The final storage class name associated with above pool 'k8s-pool', assuming a
model of 'k8s-model', becomes 'k8s-model-juju-unit-storage'.

For `microk8s`, the only difference from the creation of the corresponding
operator storage pool is the pool name:

```bash
juju create-storage-pool k8s-pool kubernetes \
	storage-class=microk8s-hostpath
```

## External storage and storage precedence rules 

Although the recommended approach is to use Juju-managed storage, Juju does
support externally created storage for both operator storage and charm storage.

For operator storage, Juju will use this order of precedence for determining
the storage it will use:

 1. a storage class called `<model name>-juju-operator-storage`
 1. a storage class called `juju-operator-storage`
 1. a storage class with label key `juju-storage`, with a value set to one of:
     - `<application name>-operator-storage`
     - `<model name>`
     - `default`
 1. a storage class with label `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`

For charm storage the rules are similar:

 1. a storage class called `<model name>-juju-unit-storage`
 1. a storage class called `juju-unit-storage`
 1. a storage class with label key `juju-storage`, with a value set to one of:
     - `<application name>-unit-storage`
     - `<model name>`
     - `default`
 1. a storage class with label `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`
