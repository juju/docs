# Troubleshooting model upgrades

This section provides strategies and techniques to assist with broken
environment upgrades. See [Model upgrades][models-upgrade] for information and
instructions pertaining to upgrading your environment.


## Case #1 - An agent does not restart (config)

It may occur that an agent does not restart upon upgrade. One thing that may
help is the inspection and modification of its `agent.conf` file. Comparing it
with its file before upgrading can be very useful.

Installing a different or modified configuration file will require a restart of
the daemon. For example, for machine #2:

```bash
juju ssh 2 'ls -lh /etc/init/juju*'
```

This will return something similar to:

```no-highlight
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 506 Sep  2 00:57 /etc/init/jujud-machine-2.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 533 Sep  2 00:57 /etc/init/jujud-unit-mysql-0.conf
```

Therefore, if the agent for machine #2 is not coming up you can connect to the
machine:

```bash
juju ssh 2
```

Modify or restore the agent file
(`/var/lib/juju/agents/machine-2/agent.conf`), and while still connected to the
machine, restart the agent:

```bash
sudo service jujud-machine-2 restart
```


## Case #2 - An agent does not restart (hook)

The restart of an agent, due to invoking `upgrade-model` or by manual means (as
above) may cause a hook for that particular unit/machine to be called. That can
sometimes lead to hook failures. Connect to that unit using the
`juju debug-hooks` command, see what is wrong, and retry the hook using the
`juju resolved` command:

```bash
juju debug-hooks etcd/2
```

In a different terminal retry the failed hook.

```bash
juju resolved etcd/2
```

See [Debugging Juju charm hooks](./developer-debugging.html) for more
information.


## Case #3 - An agent is too old

When the running agent software that is more than 1 patch point behind the
targeted upgrade version the upgrade process will abort.

One very common reason for "agent version skew" is that during a previous
upgrade the agent could not be contacted and, therefore, was not upgraded along
with the rest of the agents.

For example, the following error message will be printed when attempting to
upgrade from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 when an agent is still running, say, 2.2.0:

```no-highlight
ERROR some agents have not upgraded to the current model version 2.2.1:
machine-0, unit-ubuntu-0
```

To overcome this situation you may force the upgrade by ignoring the agent
version check:

```bash
juju upgrade-model --ignore-agent-versions
```

!!! Note:
    The flag `--ignore-agent-versions` is only available starting with Juju
    2.2.6.


## Case #4 - Dealing with an upgrade failure

If an attempted upgrade results in failure it may prove difficult to return to
a working setup and you may be compelled to start anew. Doing so will make the
old controller completely inert and you should consider it a data loss
situation.

Begin by removing the controller with the `juju destroy-controller` or
`juju kill-controller` commands. If this is insufficient you may need to ask
Juju to simply "forget" about the controller. This is done with the
`juju unregister` command.

Once the above is completed, a new controller can then be created.
