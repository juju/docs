Title: Network spaces

# Network spaces

Juju models networks using *spaces*, which can be mapped to one or more subnets
of the chosen backing cloud. When a space's subnets span multiple availability
zones Juju will automatically distribute application units across subnets and
zones, thereby providing a degree of high-availability.

From a security standpoint, with spaces, the Juju environment network topology
can be organised in a way such that applications possess only the network
connectivity they require.

Here are a few properties to keep in mind:

- Any given subnet can be part of one and only one space.
- All subnets within a space are considered "equal" in terms of routing.

!!! Note:
    Network spaces are currently only supported by the MAAS and EC2 providers.

## Use case

Consider a model divided into three segments with distinct security
requirements:

- The "dmz" space for publicly-accessible applications (e.g. HAProxy) providing
  access to the CMS application behind it.
- The "cms" space for content-management applications accessible via the "dmz"
  space only.
- The "db" space for backend database applications, which should be accessible
  only by the applications.

HAProxy is deployed inside the "dmz" space, it is accessible from the internet
and proxies HTTP requests to one or more Joomla units in the "cms" space. The
backend MySQL for Joomla is running in the "db" space. All subnets within the
"cms" and "db" spaces provide no access from outside the environment for
security reasons.

!!! Note: 
    Future development will implement isolation among spaces via firewall
    and/or access control rules. This measns that only network traffic required
    for the applications to function will be allowed between spaces.

## Adding and listing spaces and subnets

Spaces are created with the `add-space` command. The following command maps a
space called `db-space` with subnet 192.168.123.0/24:

```bash
juju add-space db-space 192.168.123.0/24
```

To see which spaces have been added, along with any subnets belonging to those
spaces, use the `juju spaces` command. Its output will look similar to the
following:

```no-highlight
Space    Subnets
db-space 192.168.123.0/24
public
undefined  192.168.122.0/24
```

To map an existing subnet to a space use the `add-subnet` command. Here we map
subnet 192.168.124.0/24 to space 'db-space':

```bash
juju add-subnet 192.168.124.0/24 db-space
```

The `juju subnets` command will list all subnets known to Juju with output
similar to the following:

```no-highlight
subnets:
  192.168.122.0/24:
    type: ipv4
    provider-id: "5"
    status: in-use
    space: undefined
    zones:
    - default
  192.168.123.0/24:
    type: ipv4
    provider-id: "6"
    status: in-use
    space: undefined
    zones:
    - default
```

### MAAS and spaces

MAAS has a native knowledge of spaces. Within MAAS, spaces can be created,
configured, and destroyed. This allows Juju to leverage MAAS spaces without the
need to add/remove spaces and subnets. However, this also means that Juju needs
to "pull" such information from MAAS. This is done by default upon
controller-creation. Run `juju reload-spaces` to refresh Juju's knowledge of
MAAS spaces and works on a per-model basis. 

!!! Note:
    The `reload-spaces` command does not currently pull in all information.
    This is being worked upon. See [LP #1747998][LP-1747998].

### Bridges

Juju creates bridges for containers *only* when Juju knows the spaces an
application may require, and the container's bridge for that application will
only connect to the required network interfaces. 

## Using spaces

Once all desired spaces have been added and/or configured they can be called
upon using either a *constraint* or a *binding*:

 - A space constraint, like any other constraint, operates at the machine
   level. It requests that certain network connections be made available to the
   Juju machine. When a constraint is used, all application endpoints get
   associated with the space.
   
     - See the [Using constraints][charms-constraints] page to learn more about
       constraints.
     - For examples of using the 'spaces' constraint, read
       [Deploying to spaces][deploying-to-network-spaces] for how to use it
       with the `deploy` command and
       [Setting constraints when adding a machine][charms-constraints-add-machine]
       for how to use it with the `add-machine` command.

 - A binding is a space-specific, software level operation and is a more
   fine-grained request. It associates an application endpoint with a subnet.

     See examples of using a binding when deploying applications on
     [Deploying to network spaces][deploying-to-network-spaces]. For using
     spaces with bundles go to [Charm bundles][charms-bundles].
