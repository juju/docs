Title: Get started with Juju 2.1

# Get started with Juju 2.1

With the release of 2.1, creating and managing a cloud deployment has never been simpler.
This is thanks to several new and significant features:

- interactive bootstrap: simply type `juju boostrap`, answer a few questions
  and let Juju do the rest.
- model migration: you can now move a model from one controller to another,
  allowing for load balancing and maintenance without losing access to your
  applications. 
- detailed output: more details on the state of a machine and a model are now
  provided, giving you greater insight over the state of your deployment.

To give you a better idea of how these features work and fit into the current
Juju environment, we're going to step through a fully functional example that
first bootstraps a new cloud, deploys an application and then migrates that
application to a new controller, all from Juju.
