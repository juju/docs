Title: Scaling applications
TODO: Check final note still relevant for 2.0 release  

# Scaling applications

One of the killer features of computing in the cloud is that it (should)
seamlessly allow you to scale up or down your applications to meet your needs
and whims. Juju not only makes it simple to deploy applications, but crucially
makes it easy to manage them too. It won't anticipate you getting slashdotted
or on the front page of hacker news (yet), but it does mean that when you do
you can reliably scale your applications to meet the demand.


##  Adding Units

The general usage to scale an application up is via the `add-unit` command:

```bash
juju add-unit [options] <application-name>
```

The command options are:

```no-highlight
#juju environment to operate in
-e, --environment <environment_name>
# number of application units to add
-n, --num-units [integer]
# the machine or container to deploy the unit in, bypasses constraints
--to <machine>
```


## Scaling behind a Load Balancer

Usually you just can't add more units to an application and have it magically 
cale - you need to use a load balancer. In this case you can just deploy a
proxy in front of your units; let's deploy a load balanced MediaWiki:

```bash
juju deploy haproxy
juju deploy mediawiki
juju deploy mysql
juju add-relation mediawiki:db mysql
juju add-relation mediawiki haproxy
juju expose haproxy
```

The haproxy charm configures and installs an
HAProxy ([http://haproxy.1wt.eu/](http://haproxy.1wt.eu/)) application, the 
widely used TCP/HTTP load balancer. When you add a relation between the
MediaWiki instance and HAProxy, it will be configured to load balance requests
to that application. Note that this means the web traffic should be directed to
the HAProxy instance. Running:

```bash
juju status haproxy
```

will return the public IP for the load balancer. This is the IP you want to
point your DNS to.

Now that you are behind a load balancer, you can grow the MediaWiki instances
behind the proxy as you see fit, let's add 5 more:

```bash
juju add-unit -n 5 mediawiki
```

You don't need to worry about manually adding your units to the load balancer.
You've made the relationship at the _application level_, so the new units know
exactly how to relate. Juju is also smart enough to ensure that the new units
are installed and configured _before_ adding them to the load balancer,
ensuring minimal user disruption of the application.


## Scaling Charms with built in Horizontal scaling

Some charms have native scaling built in. For instance, the WordPress charm
has built in load balancing. In this case, scaling up applications is really as
simple as requesting more instances. Note that this feature is charm specific,
not all charms can scale this way. Consider the following setup for a WordPress:

```bash
juju deploy mysql
juju deploy wordpress
juju add-relation mysql wordpress
juju expose wordpress
```

When you notice the WordPress instance is struggling under the load, you can
simply scale up the application:

```bash
juju add-unit wordpress
```

This will cause a new instance to be run and configured to work alongside the
currently running one. Behind the scenes, Juju is adding an instance to the
environment (also called a 'machine') and provisioning the specified application
onto that instance/machine.

Now suppose your MySQL application needs hyperscale, you can use the `-n` or
`--num-units` options to `add-unit` to specify the desired number of units you
want added to the application. For example, to scale up your application by 100
units simply do:

```bash
juju add-unit -n 100 mysql
```

or you can use `--num-unit` which has the same result, but is more readable:

```bash
juju add-unit --num-unit 100 mysql
```

### Co-location

As with the `juju deploy` command, it is possible to co-locate applications on
machines.
If you would like to add a unit to a specific machine just append the `--to`
option, for example:

```bash
juju add-unit mysql --to 23
```
...adds a unit to machine 23,

```bash 
juju add-unit mysql --to 24/lxc/3 
```
...adds a unit to lxc container 3 on host machine 24.

It is worth noting that not all applications will happily co-exist and it is much 
safer to create a new container when co-locating:
  
```bash
juju add-unit mysql --to lxc:25
```
...add unit of mysql to a new lxc container on host machine 25

## Constraints

The `add-unit` command deploys a machine matching the constraints of the
initially deployed application. For example, if MySQL was deployed with the
defaults (i.e. no `--constraints` option) you would have MySQL on an instance
that matches the closest to 1 Gigabyte of memory and 1 CPU available. If you
would like to add a unit with more resources to the MySQL application you will
first need to issue a `add-machine` with the desired constraint followed by a
`add-unit`. For example, the following command adds a 16 Gigabyte unit to the
MySQL application (note in this example `juju status` returns machine 3 for the
`add-machine` command):

```bash
juju add-machine --constraints="mem=16G"
juju add-unit mysql --to 3
```


## Scaling Back

Sometimes you may want to scale back some of your applications, and this too is
easy with Juju.

The general usage to scale down an application is with the `remove-unit` command:

```bash
juju remove-unit [options] <unit> [...]
```

For example, the following scales down the MediaWiki application by removing a
specific unit:

```bash
juju remove-unit mediawiki/1
```

If you have scaled-up the MediaWiki application by more than one unit you can
remove multiple units in the same command:

```bash
juju remove-unit mediawiki/1 mediawiki/2 mediawiki/3 mediawiki/4 mediawiki/5
```
!!! Note: the unit numbers may not necessarily be sequential, see the
[notes on machine/unit numbering](./reference-numbering)


The `remove-unit` command can be run to remove running units safely. The
running applications should automatically adjust to the change. If the machine
the removed unit was running on is not being used as a controller, or hosting
other Juju managed containers, it will be destroyed automatically.

!!! Note: If a machine has no running units, controllers or containers, and 
hasn't been removed automatically, it can be removed with the `remove-machine`
command. For example, to remove machine 1 that the unit `mediawiki/1` was
housed on, use the command: 
    
```bash
juju remove-machine 1
```

For more information on removing applications, please see the section on
[destroying applications](charms-destroy.html).
