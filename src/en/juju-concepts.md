# Concepts and terms

## Cloud

To Juju, a *cloud* (or backing cloud) is a resource which provides machines
(instances), and possibly storage, in order for application units to be
deployed upon them. This includes public clouds such as Amazon Web Services,
Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure as well as private OpenStack-based
clouds. Juju can also make use of environments which are not clouds per se, but
which Juju can nonetheless treat as a cloud. [MAAS][maas] and [LXD][lxd] fit
into this last category.

See [Clouds][clouds] to learn more.

## Controller

The Juju *controller* is the initial cloud instance which is created in order
for Juju to gain access to a cloud. It is created by having the Juju client
contact the cloud's API. The controller is a central management node for the
chosen cloud, taking care of all operations requested by the Juju client.
Multiple clouds (and thus controllers) are possible and each one may contain
multiple models and users.

For more information see [Controllers][controllers].

## Model

A *model* is associated with a single controller and is the space within which
application units are deployed. A controller can have an indefinite number of
models and each model can have an indefinite number of machines (and thus
applications). Models themselves can be shared amongst Juju users.

The controller model is the management model and is intended to contain a
single machine, the actual controller. All other models are considered regular
and are used to run workloads.

![machine][img__models]

See [Models][models] for more information.

## Charm

A Juju *charm* contains all the instructions necessary for deploying and
configuring application units. Charms are publicly available in the online
[Charm Store][charm-store] and represent the distilled knowledge of experts.
Charms make it easy to reliably and repeatedly deploy applications, then scale
up (and down) as desired with minimal effort.

The simplest scenario is when a charm is deployed (by the Juju client) with the
`deploy` command without any options to qualify the request. By default, a new
instance will be created in the backing cloud and the application will be
installed within it:

![machine][img__charms]

To see what you can do with charms visit the [Charms][charms] page.

## Container

In Juju, a *container* is a generic term that is used to refer to either a
LXD-based machine or a KVM-based machine.

## Bundle

A Juju *bundle* is a collection of charms which have been carefully combined
and configured in order to automate a multi-charm solution. For example, a
WordPress bundle may include the 'wordpress' charm, the 'mysql' charm, and the
relation between them. The operations are transparent to Juju and so the
deployment can continue to be managed by Juju as if everything was performed
manually. See [Charm bundles][charms-bundles] for more information.

## Machine

A Juju *machine* is the term used to describe a cloud instance that was
requested by Juju. Machines will usually house a single unit of a deployed
application, but this is not always the case. If directed by the user a machine
may house several units (e.g. to conserve resources) or possibly no units at
all: a machine can be created independently of applications (
`juju add-machine`), though usually this is with the intention of eventually
running an application on it!

Represented below is a very standard Juju machine. It has a single deployed
charm:

![machine][img__machine]

Here we have a machine with a deployed charm in addition to a charm deployed on
a LXD container within that machine:

![machine-lxd][img__machine-lxd]

## Unit and application

A Juju *unit* (or application unit) is deployed software. Simple applications
may be deployed with a single application unit, but it is possible for an
individual application to have multiple units running in different machines.
All units for a given application will share the same charm, the same
relations, and the same user-provided configuration.

For example, one may deploy a single MongoDB application, and specify that it
should run three units (with one machine per unit), so that the replica set is
resilient to failures. Internally, even though the replica set shares the same
user-provided configuration, each unit may be performing different roles within
the replica set, as defined by the charm.

The following diagram represents the scenario described above. For simplicity,
the agents have been omitted:

![units][img__units]

## Endpoint

An *endpoint* (or application endpoint) is used to connect to another
application's endpoint in order to form a relation. An endpoint is defined in a
charm's `metadata.yaml` by the collection of three properties: a *role*, a
*name*, and an *interface*.

There are three types of roles:

 - `requires`: The endpoint can optionally make use of services represented by
   another charm's endpoint over the given interface.
 - `provides`: The endpoint represents a service that another charm's endpoint
   can make use of over the given interface.
 - `peers`: The endpoint can coexist with another charm's endpoint in a
   peer-to-peer manner (i.e. only between units of the same application). This
   role is often used in a cluster or high availability context.

For example, the pertinent excerpt of the `metadata.yaml` file for the
'wordpress' charm is as follows:

```no-highlight
requires:
  db:
    interface: mysql
  nfs:
    interface: mount
  cache:
    interface: memcache
provides:
  website:
    interface: http
peers:
  loadbalancer:
    interface: reversenginx
```

Here, there are three 'requires' endpoints ('db', 'nfs', and 'cache'), one
'provides' endpoint ('website'), and one 'peers' endpoint ('loadbalancer'). For
instance, we can say that "the 'db' endpoint can make use of services offered
by another charm over the 'mysql' interface".

Despite the term 'requires', the three cited endpoints are not hard
requirements for the 'wordpress' charm. You will need to read the charm's entry
in the Charm Store (e.g. [wordpress][charm-store-wordpress]) to discover
actual requirements as well as how the charm works. For instance, it is not
obvious that the 'wordpress' charm comes bundled with an HTTP server (`nginx`),
making a separate HTTP-based charm not strictly necessary.

## Interface

An *interface* is the communication protocol used over a relation between
applications. In the example shown in the Endpoint section, the interfaces for
the corresponding endpoints are clearly discerned.

## Relation

Charms contain the intelligence necessary for connecting different applications
together. These inter-application connections are called *relations*, and they
are formed by connecting the applications' endpoints. Endpoints can only be
connected if they support the same interface and are of a compatible role
(requires to provides, provides to requires, peers to peers).

For example, the 'wordpress' charm supports, among others, an 'http' interface
("provides" the website) and a 'mysql' interface ("requires" a database). Any
other application which also has such interfaces can connect to this charm in a
meaningful way.

Below we see WordPress with relations set up between both MySQL and Apache (a
potential relation is shown with HAProxy):

![relations][img__relations]

Some of the above application units show unused interfaces. It is the overall
purpose of the installation which will dictate what interfaces get used. Some
relation types are required by the main charm ('wordpress' here) while some
relation types are optional. A charm's entry in the Charm Store (e.g.
[wordpress][charm-store-wordpress]) will expose such details. 

See [Managing relations][charms-relations] for more details on relations.

## Client

The Juju *client* is command line interface (CLI) software that is used to
manage Juju, whether as an administrator or as a regular user. It is installed
onto one's personal workstation. This software connects to Juju controllers and
is used to issue commands that deploy and manage application units running on
cloud instances.

![machine][img__client-2]

In the case of the localhost cloud (LXD), the cloud is a local LXD daemon
housed within the same system as the Juju client:

![machine][img__client-3]

LXD itself can operate over the network and Juju does support this (`v.2.5.0`).

See the [Client][client] page for how to backup and upgrade the Juju client.

## Agent

A Juju *agent* is software that runs on every Juju machine. There is a *machine
agent* that operates at the machine level and a *unit agent* that works at the
application unit level. Thus there are typically at least two agents running on
each regular (non-controller) machine: one for the machine and one for a
deployed application/charm. The controller normally has a single machine agent
running.

A machine agent manages its respective unit agents as well as any containers
that may be requested on that machine. In particular, it is the machine agent
that creates the unit agent. The unit agents are responsible for all charm
related tasks.

In general, all agents track state changes, respond to those changes, and pass
updated information back to the controller. A model's status (`status` command)
is built up from the communication between a controller and all the agents
running in that model. Agents are also responsible for all logging that goes on
in Juju (see [Model logs][troubleshooting-logs#juju-agents] for details).

The agent's software version is generally consistent across a controller (and
its models) and is thus determined at controller-creation time. By default the
agent uses the same version as that of the local Juju client but this can be
tweaked if desired. See
[Agent versions and streams][agent-versions-and-streams] for how to do this.
