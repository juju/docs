Title: General configuration options  
Commands: get-env, set-env  

# General configuration options

There may be times, particularly when dealing with complex cloud environments
or running multiple instances of Juju, where it would be useful to control
further aspects of the Juju environment. Many options can be changed by adding
extra key:value pairs to the environments.yaml file which Juju uses to initiate
environments. Options which are specific to certain cloud providers are
detailed in the individual configuration pages, but there are additional
settings which can be applied to any environment. Some of these may be useful
for particular use cases as outlined in the sections below, or you can
[skip to the table](#alphabetical-list-of-general-configuration-values) of all
the values.


## Getting and setting individual values

You can display the environment settings of a running Juju environment by
running the command:

```bash
juju get-env
```

This will include all the currently set options - whether they were set
by the individual configuration in the environments.yaml file, set specifically
by you or inherited as a default value. 

You may also set individual values for the current environment using the
corresponding ```juju set-env``` command, and providing a key=value pair:

```bash
juju set-env noproxy=jujucharms.com
```

Some values will need to be specified via the environments.yaml file, as not
all values can be applied to a running environment.

!!! Note: Juju does not currently check that the provided key is a valid
setting, so make sure you spell it correctly.


## Apt mirror

The APT packaging system is used to install and upgrade software on
machines provisioned in the environment, and many charms also use APT to
install software for the services they deploy. It is possible to set a
specific mirror for the APT packages to use, by setting "apt-mirror" in the
environments.yaml file or directly in a running environment:

```bash
juju set-env apt-mirror=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

It is also possible to set this to a local mirror if desired.

You may also run:

```bash
juju unset-env apt-mirror
```
to restore the default behaviour in a running environment.


## Versions and streams

The ```agent-stream``` option selects the versions of Juju which an environment
can deploy and upgrade to. This defaults to "released", indicating that only
the latest stable versions of Juju should be used, which is the recommended
setting.

To run the upcoming stable release (before it has passed the normal QA process)
you can set:

```yaml
agent-stream: proposed
```

Alternatively, for testing purposes, you can use the latest unstable version of
Juju by setting:

```yaml
agent-stream: devel
```

### Updating from versions prior to 1.21.1

If you have an existing test environment using tools-metadata-url or
agent-metadata-url to test proposed versions, you can still upgrade to 1.21.1+.
After you upgrade, you can update the environment to use the devel streams at
the default stream location:

```bash
juju unset-env agent-metadata-url
juju set-env agent-stream=proposed
```

Subsequent upgrades will "just work".


## Provision machines faster by disabling software upgrades

When Juju provisions a machine, its default behaviour is to upgrade existing
packages to their latest version. If your OS images are fresh and/or your
deployed services do not require the latest package versions, you can disable
upgrades in order to provision machines faster.

Two Boolean configuration options are available to disable APT updates and
upgrades: `enable-os-refresh-update` (apt-get update) and `enable-os-upgrade`
(apt-get upgrade), respectively. By default, these are both set to 'true'.
To disable them set them to 'false' in environments.yaml like so:

```yaml
enable-os-refresh-update: false
enable-os-upgrade: false
```

You may also want to just update the package list to ensure a Charm has the
latest software available to it by disabling upgrades but enabling updates.

### Local provider

The local provider, however, skips upgrades by default for faster provisioning.
If you wish to enable upgrades in your local development, you will need to
explicitly set enable-os-upgrade to "true".

If you are using the local provider to develop charms or test, you will want to
regularly purge the Juju LXC template and LXC host cache to be certain you are
using fresh images. See
[Installing and configuring Juju for LXC (Linux)](./config-LXC.html#ensuring-a-fresh-cache).


## NUMA

The Juju state server can be run in a mode tuned to be efficient on NUMA
hardware. To enable this feature you should add the following to your
environments.yaml file:

```yaml
set-numa-control-policy: true
```

It is not desirable to set this feature on hardware which is not NUMA
compatible.


## Juju lifecycle and harvesting

Juju keeps state on the running environment from which it builds a model.
Based on that model, it can harvest machines which it deems are no longer
required. This can help reduce running costs and keep the environment 'tidy'.
Harvesting is guided by what "harvesting mode" has been set by the
system administrator. 

Before explaining the different modes, it is useful to understand how Juju
perceives machines. As far as it is concerned, machines are in one of four
states:

- **Alive:** The machine is running and being used.
- **Dying:** The machine is in the process of being terminated by Juju, but hasn't
yet finished.
- **Dead:** The machine has been successfully brought down by Juju, but is still
being tracked for removal.
- **Unknown:** The machine exists, but Juju knows nothing about it.

### Harvesting modes
With the above in mind, Juju can use one of several strategies to delete or harvest
machines from the environment

- **None:** Using this method, Juju won't harvest any machines. This is the
most conservative, and a good choice if you manage your machines
using a separate process outside of Juju.
- **Destroyed:** This is the default setting. Juju will harvest only machine
instances that are dead, and that Juju knows about. Unknown instances will
not be harvested.
- **Unknown:** With this method, Juju will harvest only instances that Juju
doesn't know about. Use this with caution in a mixed environment or one which 
may contain multiple instances of Juju.
- **All:** This is the most aggressive setting. In this mode Juju will
terminate all instances which it considers to be "destroyed" or "unknown". 
This is a good option if you are only utilising Juju for your
environment.

The default mode can be overridden by setting the 

```yaml
provisioner-harvest-mode:
```
to any of the above values.
