Title: Writing your first Juju charm  


# Your first charm starts here!

Okay, so you have read up all the background info on what a charm is, how it
works, and what parts of the charm do what, now it is time to dust off your
favourite code editor (no arguments please) and get charming!

Although it is possible to create a charm without using anything other than a
text editor, we are also going to make use of the very excellent time saving
plugin for Juju, Charm Tools. [ Find out how to get and install charm tools here
](tools-charm-tools.html). Then hurry back.

For this example, we are imagining that we want to create a charm for [the
Vanilla forum software](http://vanillaforums.org/)

## Prepare yourself

As we are writing a charm, it makes sense to create it in a local charm
repository (see how to deploy from a local repository
[here](./charms-deploying.html)) to make it easy to test in your Juju 
environment.

Go to your home directory (or wherever is appropriate and make the appropriate
file structure:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p charms/precise
cd charms/precise
```

## Create a bare bones charm with Charm Tools

Using the charm tools plugin, we can create the directory structure we need for
our charm quickly and easily:

```bash
juju charm create vanilla
```

This not only creates the directory structure, it also populates it with
template files for you to edit. Your directory will now look like this:

![directory tree](./media/author-charm-writing-01.png)

## Create the README file

Fire up your text editor and load/edit the README file.

This step is especially important if you intend making your charm public, but it
is very useful even if your charm will only ever be seen by you. The README is a
good place to make notes about how the charm works, what information it expects
to communicate and how.

Although a plain text file is fine, you can also write your README file using
Markdown (in which case use the .md suffix). The advantage of this, other than
it looks quite neat, is that the Charm Store will render Markdown properly
online, so your README will look and read better.

Here is a quick example README file for our Vanilla charm:

```no-highlight
 # Overview
 Vanilla is a powerful open source web-based forum. This charm will deploy 
 the forum software and connect it to a running MySQL database. This charm 
 will install the Vanilla files in /var/www/vanilla/
 # Installation
 To deploy this charm you will need at a minimum: a cloud environment,
 working Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped,
 deploy the MySQL charm and then this Vanilla charm:
     juju deploy mysql
     juju deploy vanilla
 Add a relation between the two of them:
     juju add-relation mysql vanilla
 And finally expose the Vanilla service:
     juju expose vanilla
```
Obviously, you can include any useful info you wish.

## Make some metadata.yaml

The `metadata.yaml` file is really important. This is the file that Juju reads
to find out what a charm is, what it does and what it needs to do it.

The YAML syntax is at once simple, but exact, so if you have any future problems
with Juju not recognising your charm, this is the first port of call! The
information is stored in simple `<key> : <value>` associations. The
first four are pretty self explanatory:

```yaml
name: vanilla
summary: Vanilla is an open-source, pluggable, multi-lingual forum.
maintainer: Your Name <your@email.tld>
description: |
  Vanilla is designed to deploy and grow small communities to scale.
  This charm deploys Vanilla Forums as outlined by the Vanilla Forums
  installation guide.
tags: social
```

The summary should be a brief description of the service being deployed, whereas
the description can go into more detail.

The next value to define is the tag. This is primarily for organising the
charm in the charm store. The available tags are:

- analytics
- big_data
- ecommerce
- openstack
- cloudfoundry
- cms
- social
- streaming
- wiki
- ops
- backup
- identity
- monitoring
- performance
- audits
- security
- network
- storage
- database
- cache-proxy
- application_development - use this for platform charms like Rails, Django, etc.
- web_server

Your charm can belong to more than one tag, though in almost all cases it
should be in just one. Because there could be more than one entry here, the YAML
is formatted as a list:

```yaml
tags:
   - social
   - wiki
   - ecommerce
```

Next we need to explain which services are actually provided by this service.
This is done using an indent for each service provided, followed by a
description of the interface. The interface name is important as it can be used
elsewhere in the environment to relate back to this charm, e.g. when writing
hooks.

Our Vanilla charm is a web-based service which exposes a simple HTTP interface:

```yaml

provides:
  website:
    interface: http
```

The name given here is important as it will be used in hooks that we write
later, and the interface name will be used by other charms which may want to
relate to this one.

Similarly we also need to provide a "requires" section. In this case we need a
database. Checking out the metadata of the charm for MySQL we can see that it
provides this via the interface name "mysql", so we can use this name in our
metadata.

The final file should look like this:

```yaml
name: vanilla
summary: Vanilla is an open-source, pluggable, themeable, multi-lingual forum.
maintainer: Your Name <your@email.tld>
description: |
  Vanilla is designed to deploy and grow small communities to scale.
  This charm deploys Vanilla Forums as outlined by the Vanilla Forums installation guide.
tags:
  - social
provides:
  website:
    interface: http
requires:
  database:
    interface: mysql
```

For some charms you will want a "peers" section also. This follows the same
format, and its used for optional connections, such as you might use for
interconnecting services in a cluster

## Writing hooks

As you will know from your thorough reading of the [charm components](./authors-
charm-components.html), the hooks are the important scripts that actually do
things. You can write hooks in whatever language you can reasonably expect to
execute on your deployed environment (e.g. Ubuntu Server).

For our charm, the hooks we will need to create are:

  - start - for when the service needs to be started.
  - stop - for stopping it again.
  - install - for actually fetching and installing the Vanilla code.
  - database-relation-changed - this will run when we connect (or re-connect, 
    or disconnect) our service to the MySQL database. This hook will need to 
    manage this connection.
  - website-relation-joined - this will run when/if a service connects to our 
    charm.

So first up we should create the hooks directory, and start creating our first
hook:

```bash
mkdir hooks
cd hooks
vi start
```

(Use your favourite editor, naturally - no flames please)

We have started with the start hook, because it is pretty simple. Our charm will
be served up by Apache, so all we need to do to start the service is make sure
Apache is running:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
service apache2 restart
```

A bit of explanation for this one. As we are writing in bash, and we need the
files to be executable, we start with a hash-bang line indicating this is a bash
file. the set -e line means that if any subsequent command returns false (non-
zero) the script will stop and raise an error - this is important so that Juju
can work out if things are running properly.

The final line starts the Apache web server, thus also starting our Vanilla
service. Why do we call 'restart'? One of the important ideas behind hooks is
that they should be 'idempotent'. That means that the operation should be
capable of being run many times without changing the intended result
(basically). In this case, we don't want an error if Apache is actually already
running, we just want it to run and reload any config changes.

Once you have saved the file, it is important to make sure that you set it to be
executable too!

```bash
chmod +x start
```

With the easy bit out of the way, how about the install hook? This needs to
install any dependencies, fetch the actual software and do any other config and
service jobs that need to happen. Here is an example for our vanilla charm:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # If any command fails, stop execution of the hook with that error
apt-get install -y apache2 php5-cgi php5-mysql curl php5-gd wget libapache2-mod-php5
dl="https://github.com/vanillaforums/Garden/archive/Vanilla_2.0.18.8.tar.gz"
# Grab Vanilla from upstream.
status-set maintenance "Fetching and installing Vanilla"
wget "$dl" -O /tmp/vanilla.tar.gz
# IDEMPOTENCY is very important in all charm hooks, even the install hook.
if [ -f /var/www/vanilla/conf/config.php ]; then
  cp /var/www/vanilla/conf/config.php /tmp/
  rm -rf /var/www/vanilla
fi
# Extract to a known location
juju-log "Extracting Vanilla"
tar -xvzf /tmp/vanilla.tar.gz -C /var/www/
mv /var/www/vanilla-Vanilla* /var/www/vanilla
if [ -f /tmp/config.php ]; then
  mv /tmp/config.php /var/www/vanilla/conf/
fi
chmod -R 777 /var/www/vanilla/conf /var/www/vanilla/uploads /var/www/vanilla/cache
status-set maintenance "Creating apache2 configuration"
cat <<EOF > /etc/apache2/sites-available/vanilla
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
  DocumentRoot /var/www/vanilla
  <Directory /var/www/vanilla>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
  </Directory>
  ErrorLog \${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/vanilla.log
  LogLevel warn
  CustomLog \${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
EOF
a2dissite 000-default
a2ensite vanilla
service apache2 reload
status-set blocked "Waiting for active database connection" 
```

We aren't going to go for a line-by-line explanation of that, but there are a
few things worth noting

Firstly, note the use of the -y option of the apt-get command. this assumes a
'yes' answer to any questions and removes any manual install options (e.g.
services that run config dialogs when they install).

In our script, we are fetching the tarball of the Vanilla software. In these
cases, it is obviously always better to point to a specific, permanent link to a
version of the software.

Also, you will notice that we have used the `juju-log` command and the 
`status-set` command. These are helper commands for Juju hooks (known as
"Hook tools") and you will find them covered in more detail
in the ["how hooks are run" page](authors-hook-environment.html).

The `status-set` command is used to update the status and message displayed by
Juju when users run the `juju status` command to see what is going on in the 
environment. There are a number of pre-defined statuses explained in more 
detail [status reference page](reference-status.html). It is a good idea
to think about updating the status when significant events occur which have an
effect on the operation of the service.

The `juju-log` command basically spits messages out into the Juju log, which is 
very useful for testing and debugging. We will cover that in more detail later
in this walk through.

The next step is to create the relationship hooks...

We know from our metadata that we have a connection called 'database', so we can
have hooks that relate to that. Note that we don't have to create hooks for all
possible events if they are not required - if Juju doesn't find a hook file for
a particular action, it just assumes everything is okay and carries on. It is up
to you to decide which events require a hook.

Let's take a stab at the 'database-relation-changed' hook:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # If any command fails, stop execution of the hook with that error
db_user=`relation-get user`
db_db=`relation-get database`
db_pass=`relation-get password`
db_host=`relation-get private-address`
if [ -z "$db_db" ]; then
  juju-log "No database information sent yet. Silently exiting"
  exit 0
fi
vanilla_config="/var/www/vanilla/conf/config.php"
cat <<EOF > $vanilla_config
<?php if (!defined('APPLICATION')) exit();
\$Configuration['Database']['Host'] = '$db_host';
\$Configuration['Database']['Name'] = '$db_db';
\$Configuration['Database']['User'] = '$db_user';
\$Configuration['Database']['Password'] = '$db_pass';
EOF
juju-log "Make the application port available, now that we know we have a site to expose"
status-set active
open-port 80
```

You will notice that this script uses the backticked command relation-get. This
is another Juju Hook tool, which in this case fetches the named values from 
the corresponding hook on the service we are connecting to. Usually there will
be some indication of what these values are, but you can always inspect the
corresponding hooks to find out. In this case we know that when connected, the 
'mysql' charm will create a database and generate random values for things like a
username and password.

Interfaces in general are determined by the consensus of the charms which use
them. There is a lot [more information on decoding interfaces here](./authors-
charm-interfaces.html). Some of the major interfaces are being documented to
make it easier to use them, and fortunately, mysql is one of them - [You can
find a description of the mysql interface here](./interface-mysql.html).

These values will all be set at one time, so the next little bit of script just
checks one value to see if it exists - if not the corresponding charm hasn't set
the values yet.

When it has the values we can use these to modify the config file for Vanilla in
the relevant place, and finally open the port to make the service active.

The final hook we need to write is for other services which may want to consume
Vanilla, `website-relation-joined`.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
relation-set hostname=`unit-get private-address` port=80
```

Here we can see the other end of the information sharing - in this case
relation-set exposes the given values to the connecting charm. In this case one
of the commands is backticked, as unit-get is another helper command, in this
case one which returns the requested value form the machine the charm is running
on, specifically here it's IP address.

So, any connecting charm will be able to ask for the values `hostname` and
`port`. Remember, once you have finished writing your hooks make sure you `chmod
+x` them.

For our simplistic charm, that is all the hooks we need for the moment, so now
we can test it out!

## Run the charm proof tool

Another part of the Charm Tools plugin is a useful lint-like tool which will
check for errors in the files of your charm. Run it like this:

```bash
juju charm proof [CHARM_DIRECTORY]
```

The output classifies messages as:

- I - for information
- W - A warning; something which should be looked at but won't necessarily stop
  the charm from working.
- E - An error; these are blocker which must be fixed for the charm to be used.

some example output might be:

```no-highlight
E: no copyright file
E: README.ex Includes boilerplate README.ex line 1
I: relation peer-relation has no hooks
```

Which tells you that you forgot to add a `copyright` file, you have left some
default text in the README, and one of your relations has no hooks. All useful
stuff.


## Testing

Before we congratulate ourselves too much, we should check that the charm
actually works. To help with this, we should open a new terminal window and run
the following command:

```bash
juju debug-log
```

This starts a process to tail the Juju log file and show us just exactly what is
happening. It won't do much to begin with, but you should see messages appearing
when we start to deploy our charm. See 
[Viewing logs](./troubleshooting-logs.html#the-debug-log-command) for more details.

Following our own recipe, in another terminal we should now do the following
(assuming you already have a bootstrapped environment):

```bash
juju deploy mysql
juju deploy --repository=/home/$USER/charms/ local:precise/vanilla
juju add-relation mysql vanilla
juju expose vanilla
```

We used the local deploy options to deploy our charm - substitute the path for
your own environment. Everything should now be working away, and your log window
will look something like this:

![Step five - debug](./media/author-charm-writing-debug.png)

If you wait for all the Juju operations to finish and run a juju status command,
you will be able to retrieve the public address for the Vanilla forum we just
deployed. Copy it into your browser and you should see the setup page
(pre-populated with the database config) waiting for any changes.
Congratulations!

## Tidying up

With the charm working properly, you may consider everything a job well done. If
your charm is really great and you want to share it, particularly on the charm
store, then there are a couple of things you ought to add.

1. Create a file called 'copyright' and place whatever license information you 
   require in there.
1. Add a beautiful icon 
   ([there is a guide to making one here](./authors-charm-icon.html)) so others
   can recognise it in the charm store!
