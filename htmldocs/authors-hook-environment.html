<section id="hook-execution-environment">
<h1>How hooks are run</h1>

<p>When a charm is deployed onto a unit, the raw charm is extracted into a
directory; this directory is known as the charm directory. It's owned and
operated by juju, and juju sometimes temporarily cedes control of it to
user code, by running a hook inside it.</p>

<p>When a hook's running, it should be considered to have sole access to the
charm directory; at all other times, you should consider that juju may be
making arbitrarily scary changes to the directory, and that it is not safe
to read or write to anything in there at all.</p>

<p>This is to say that the software you install must, once it's running, be
entirely independent of the charm that created it. It's fine (and encouraged,
with some caveats) to store <em>charm</em> state in the charm directory, but the
state of your <em>software</em> must remain unperturbed by direct changes to the
charm.</p>

<p>So, every hook runs with easy access to the charm files. Every hook also runs
as root, with a number of useful variables set, and has access to hook-specific
tools that let you interrogate and affect the juju environment.</p>

<p>No more than one hook will execute on a given system at a given time. A unit in
a container is considered to be on a different system to any unit on the
container's host machine.</p>
</section>

<section id="environment-variables">
<h2>Environment variables</h2>

<p>The following variables are always available.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>$CHARM_DIR</code> variable is the path to the charm directory.</li>
    <li>The <code>$PATH</code> variable is prefixed with the path to the hook tools
    directory.</li>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_UNIT_NAME</code> variable holds the name of the unit.</li>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_API_ADDRESSES</code> variable holds a space-separated list of API
    server addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, every relation hook makes available relation-specific variables.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_RELATION</code> variable holds the relation name. This
    information is of limited value, because it's always the same as the part of
    the hook name just before &quot;-relation-&quot;.</li>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_RELATION_ID</code> variable holds an opaque relation
    identifier, used to distinguish between multiple relations with the same name.
    It is vitally important, because it's the only reasonable way of telling the
    difference between (say) a database service's many independent clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>...and, if that relation hook is not a -broken hook:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT</code> variable holds the name of the unit which
    is being reported to have -joined, -changed, or -departed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Juju does <em>not</em> pay any attention to the values of the above variables when
running hook tools: they're a one-way communication channel from juju to
the charm only. Finally, in all cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_AGENT_SOCKET</code> and <code>$JUJU_CONTEXT_ID</code> variables
    allow the hook tools to work: juju <em>does</em> pay attention to them, but you
    should treat them as opaque and avoid messing with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you're <a href="./authors-hook-debug.html">debugging</a>, you'll also
have access to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>$JUJU_HOOK_NAME</code> variable, which will be set to the current
    hook name.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="hook-tools">
<h2>Hook tools</h2>

<p>All hook tools are available in all hooks. Many of the tools produce output,
and those that do accept a <code>--format</code> flag whose value can be set to
<code>json</code> or <code>yaml</code> as desired. If it's not specified, the format
defaults to <code>smart</code>, which transforms the basic output as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>strings are left untouched</li>
    <li>boolean values are converted to the strings <code>True</code> and
    <code>False</code></li>
    <li>ints and floats are converted directly to strings</li>
    <li>lists of strings are converted to a single newline-separated string</li>
    <li>all other types (in general, dictionaries) are formatted as YAML</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools which do not produce output also accept the <code>--format</code> flag,
but ignore it, for compatibility reasons.</p>

<p>The various &quot;relation-&quot; tools infer context from the hook where
possible. If they're running in a relation hook, the current relation id is set
as the default; and if they're running in a -joined, -changed, or -broken hook,
the current remote unit is set as the default.</p>

<p>Best use of relation hooks will be made by those who understand the
<a href="./authors-relations-in-depth">relation model</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="juju-log">
<h3>juju-log</h3>

<p><code>juju-log</code> writes its arguments directly to the unit's log file.
All hook output is currently logged anyway, so it's theoretically redundant with
<code>echo</code>, but this is an implementation detail and should not be depended
upon. If it's important, please <code>juju-log</code> it.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
juju-log "some important text"
</pre>

<p>It accepts a <code>--debug</code> flag which causes the message to be logged
at <code>DEBUG</code> level; in all other cases it's logged at <code>INFO</code>
level. The <code>-l</code>/<code>--level</code> argument is ignored, and is present
only to prevent legacy charms from entirely failing to run; the inability to specify
logging levels and targets in more detail is a known
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1223325">bug</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="unit-get">
<h3>unit-get</h3>

<p><code>unit-get</code> returns information about the local unit. It accepts a
single argument, which must be <code>private-address</code> or
<code>public-address</code>. It is not affected by context. So</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
unit-get private-address
</pre>
<p>has an output like</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
10.0.1.101
</pre>
<p>while</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
unit-get public-address
</pre>
<p>may return</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
foo.example.com
</pre>
</section>

<section id="config-get">
<h3>config-get</h3>

<p><code>config-get</code> returns information about the service configuration (as
defined by the charm). If called without arguments, it returns a dictionary
containing all config settings that are either explicitly set, or which
have a non-nil default value. If the <code>--all</code> flag is passed, it returns
a dictionary containing all definied config settings including nil values
(for those without defaults). If called with a single argument, it returns
the value of that config key. Missing config keys are reported as having a
value of nil, and do not return an error.</p>

<p>Getting the interesting bits of the config is done with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
config-get
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
key: some-value
another-key: default-value
</pre>
<p>To get the whole config including the nulls:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
config-get --all
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
key: some-value
another-key: default-value
no-default: null
</pre>

<p>To retrieve a specific value pass its key as argument:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
config-get [key]
</pre>
<p>Here only the value without the key as prefix is returned.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
some-value
</pre>

<p>The command can also be call if no value is set and no default
is set of even if the setting doesn't exist. In both cases nothing
will be returned.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
config-get [key-with-no-default]
config-get [missing-key]
</pre>
<p class = "note"><strong>Note: </strong> The above two examples are not misprints
 - asking for a value which doesn't exist or has not been set returns nothing and
raises no errors.</p> 
</section>

<section id="open-port">
<h3>open-port</h3>

<p><code>open-port</code> marks a port on the local system as appropriate to
open, if and when the service is exposed to the outside world. It accepts a single
port with an optional protocol, which may be <code>udp</code> or <code>tcp</code>,
where <code>tcp</code> is the default.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Open 80/tcp if and when the service is exposed:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
open-port 80
</pre>
<p>Open 1234/udp if and when the service is exposed:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
open-port 1234/udp
</code></pre>

<p><code>open-port</code> will not have any effect if the service is not exposed,
and may have a somewhat delayed effect even if it is. It accepts and ignores
<code>--format</code>, because it doesn't produce any output.</p>

</section>

<section id="close-port">
<h3>close-port</h3>
<p><code>close-port</code> unmarks a local system port. If the service is not
exposed, it has no effect; otherwise the port is marked for imminent closure. It
accepts the same flags and arguments as <code>open-port</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Close 1234/udp if it was open:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
close-port 1234/udp
</pre>
<p>Close port 80 if it was open:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
close-port 80
</pre>
</section>

<section id="relation-set">
<h3>relation-set</h3>

<p><code>relation-set</code> writes the local unit's settings for some relation. It
accepts any number of <code>key=value</code> strings, and an optional <code>-r</code>
argument, which defaults to the current relation id. If it's not running in a relation
hook, <code>-r</code> needs to be specified. The <code>value</code> part of an argument
is not inspected, and is stored directly as a string. Setting an empty string causes
the setting to be removed.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Setting a pair of values for the local unit in the default relation which is 
stored in the environment variable <code>JUJU_RELATION_ID</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
echo $JUJU_RELATION_ID
</pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
server:3
</pre>
<p>The setting  done with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-set username=bob password=2db673e81ffa264c
</pre>

<p>To set the pair of values for the local unit in a specific relation specify
the relation id:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-set -r server:3 username=jim password=12345
</pre>
<p>To clear a value for the local unit in the default relation enter:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-set deprecated-or-unused=
</pre>

<p><code>relation-set</code> is the single tool at your disposal for communicating
your own configuration to units of related services. At least by convention, the
charm that <code>provides</code> an interface is likely to set values, and a charm
that <code>requires</code> that interface will read them; but there's nothing
forcing this. Whatever information you need to propagate for the remote charm to
work must be propagated via relation-set, with the single exception of the
<code>private-address</code> key, which is always set before the unit joins.</p>

<p>You may wish to overwrite the <code>private-address</code> setting, for example
if you're writing a charm that serves as a proxy for some external service; but
you should in general avoid <em>removing</em> that key, because most charms expect
that value to exist unconditionally.</p>

<p>All values set are stored locally until the hook completes; at that point,
if the hook exit code is 0, all changed values will be communicated to the
rest of the system, causing -changed hooks to run in all related units.</p>

<p>There is no way to write settings for any unit other than the local unit; but
any hook on the local unit can write settings for any relation the local unit is
participating in.</p>

</section>

<section id="relation-get">
<h3>relation-get</h3>

<p><code>relation-get</code> reads the settings of the local unit, or of any
remote unit, in a given relation (set with <code>-r</code>, defaulting to the
current relation, as in <code>relation-set</code>). The first argument specifies
the settings key, and the second the remote unit, which may be omitted if a
default is available (that is, when running a relation hook other than -broken).</p>

<p>If the first argument is omitted, a dictionary of all current keys and values
will be printed; all values are always plain strings without any interpretation.
If you need to specify a remote unit but want to see all settings, use <code>-</code>
for the first argument.</p>

<p>The environment variable <code>JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT</code> stores the default
remote unit. So</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
echo $JUJU_REMOTE_UNIT
</pre>
<p>prints</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
mongodb/2
</pre>
<p>Getting the settings of the default unit in the default relation is done
with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-get
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
username: jim
password: "12345"
</pre>
<p>To get one setting from the default remote unit in the default relation enter:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-get username
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
jim
</pre>
<p>To get all settings from a particular remote unit in a particular relation you
specify them together with the command. So</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-get -r database:7 - mongodb/5
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
username: bob
password: 2db673e81ffa264c
</pre>

<p>Note that <code>relation-get</code> produces results that are <em>consistent</em>
but not necessarily <em>accurate</em>, in that you will always see settings that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>were accurate at some point in the reasonably recent past
    <li>are always the same within a single hook run...
    <li class=" sub"><em>except</em> when inspecting the unit's own relation settings,
    in which case local changes from <code>relation-set</code> will be seen correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should never depend upon the presence of any given key in <code>relation-get</code>
output. Processing that depends on specific values (other than
<code>private-addres</code>) should be restricted to -changed hooks for the relevant
unit, and the absence of a remote unit's value should never be treated as an
<a href="./authors-hook-errors.html">error</a> in the local unit.</p>

<p>In practice, it is common and encouraged for -relation-changed hooks to exit
early, without error, after inspecting <code>relation-get</code> output and
determining it to be inadequate; and for <a href="./authors-hook-kinds.html">all
other hooks</a> to be resilient in the face of missing keys, such that
-relation-changed hooks will be sufficient to complete all configuration that
depends on remote unit settings.</p>

<p>Settings for remote units already known to have departed remain accessible
for the lifetime of the relation.</p>

<p><code>relation-get</code> currently has a
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1223339">bug</a> that allows units
of the same service to see each other's settings outside of a peer relation. Depending
on this behaviour is foolish in the extreme: if you need to share settings between
units of the same service, always use a peer relation to do so, or you may be
seriously inconvenienced when the hole is closed without notice.</p>

</section>

<section id="relation-list">
<h3>relation-list</h3>

<p><code>relation-list</code> accepts the <code>-r</code> flag as above, and
outputs the names of every remote unit currently known to be in the relation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>To show all remote units in the current relation enter:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-list
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
mongodb/0
mongodb/2
mongodb/3
</pre>

<p>All remote units in a specific relation can be shown with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-list -r website:2
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
haproxy/0
</pre>

</section>

<section id="relation-ids">
<h3>relation-ids</h3>

<p><code>relation-ids</code> accepts a single argument which, in a relation
hook, defaults to the name of the current relation.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>The current relation is stored in the environment variable <code>JUJU_RELATION</code>.
So all relations like the current one can be shown with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-ids
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
server:1
server:7
server:9
</pre>

<p>To show all relations with a given name pass it as argument:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
relation-ids reverseproxy
</pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">
reverseproxy:3
</pre>

<p>Note again that all commands that produce output accept <code>--format json</code>
and <code>--format yaml</code>, and you may consider it smarter to use those for
clarity's sake than to depend on the default <code>smart</code> format.
